{"transcript-royal-institution-chartered-surveyors-rics-building-confidence-conference": ["23 November 2020", "**check against delivery** introduction it is a pleasure to be addressing this \u2018virtual\u2019 gathering. the focus of today\u2019s conference is on the delivery of major construction and infrastructure projects, and for my part, how infrastructure can be a policy lever that creates aggregate demand at a time when our economy needs it. i thank the royal institution of chartered surveyors for hosting this timely event. it comes a month after the treasurer delivered the seventh budget of a coalition government. it was a budget which increased our funding commitments for transport infrastructure to a new record of $110 billion over ten years. of course, the very idea of a ten-year horizon for commonwealth infrastructure investments does, in and of itself, help with forward planning for a variety of industry sectors. a 10-year rolling pipeline of commonwealth projects \u2013 a concept introduced by the coalition government \u2013 is now well accepted in canberra. the city deal concept is another coalition initiative, through which we provide long-term certainty for commercial decision makers. in turn, city deal commitments also help populate our ten-year pipeline of projects. certainty in our policy settings is the optimal approach across all of my portfolio responsibilities, as minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure. at least, in a normal year, but 2020 is anything but normal for population policy. as the prime minister said in early march: \u00a0\u2018whatever you thought 2020 was going to be about. think again\u2019. we are facing some important challenges ahead with our migration and population forecasts. a significant reduction in migration while necessary, border closures have had a significant impact on the australia\u2019s migration outlook. australia\u2019s population growth is expected to slow to its lowest rate in over a hundred years. the budget assumes population growth of around 0.2 per cent in this financial year and 0.4 per cent in 2021-22. over time, migration has made a substantial contribution to australia\u2019s prosperity and the current reduction will adversely impact economic growth. to counterbalance these and other effects of the pandemic, our budget strategy is squarely focused on supporting jobs and growth. as the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure, and as the acting minister for immigration, i have responsibility for putting both our population and infrastructure strategies into action. economic fundamentals and the economic fightback the rba has confirmed that australia\u2019s economic recovery is well underway and upgraded their forecasts for australia\u2019s economic growth and for our labour market. recent employment data shows our economy is continuing to recover from the global pandemic, with the australian economy adding 178,800 jobs in october, exceeding all market expectations. since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, the government has provided $257 billion in direct economic support to cushion the blow and strengthen the recovery. the 2020-21 budget commits a further $98 billion including, $25 billion in direct covid-19 response measures and $74 billion in new measures to create jobs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 under our plan, the economy is forecast to grow by 4\u00bc per cent next calendar year and unemployment is expected to fall to 6\u00bd per cent by the june quarter 2022. without the government\u2019s economic support, the unemployment rate would have risen, and remained, above 12 per cent throughout 2020-21 and 2021-22. our plan will grow the economy and create jobs. and one way we will do this is by investing more in infrastructure to help create these jobs. infrastructure investment continuing during covid-19 this conference is titled the building confidence conference. and this is precisely what the morrison government is doing. what treasury says is that we need to boost aggregate demand in our economy \u2013 and one way we can do that is through building the infrastructure we need for the future. covid-19 has not slowed down our work on achieving major projects.\u00a0 since march, we have seen the completion of major projects, part-funded by the commonwealth, in most states: importantly, late last month, i was pleased to join with the nsw premier to officially open the northconnex project \u2013 a gamechanger for nsw: reducing travel times by up to 15 minutes and allowing drivers to avoid 21 sets of traffic lights along pennant hills road. more than 17,000 jobs were supported by this project since construction first began. on saturday, the australian and victorian governments announced the long-awaited melbourne airport rail link \u2013 a gamechanger for victoria, and a project that has eluded successive governments for decades. we are getting it done. it will mean that from 2029, victorians will be able to catch a train directly from the cbd to the airport. the airport link is a nationally significant project and victorians have been waiting a long time for it to become a reality. it will support up to 8,000 jobs during construction, and, when complete, it will slash travel times, bust congestion and be a major boost to the economy. also on saturday, the australian and victorian governments announced the geelong fast rail project \u2013 another boon for infrastructure in my home state. construction of geelong fast rail is expected to be underway from 2023, subject to relevant planning, environmental and government approvals. it will support over 2,800 jobs during construction. it will deliver a major boost for the city of geelong, where the population is expected to grow by almost 50 per cent in the next 30 years. these are just some examples of our ongoing pipeline of road and infrastructure projects, which will deliver improvements to the lives of ordinary australians. new budget measures the 2020-21 budget brings our transport infrastructure investment program over the next ten years to a record $110 billion. these investments will support local jobs and businesses at the time it is needed most. over the life of these jobmaker investments we will see an additional estimated 30,000 direct and indirect jobs injected into the economy. we are driving the delivery of major infrastructure projects as we map the economic road back from the pandemic. every state and territory will see new funding for critical transport infrastructure projects \u2013 these include: we are also providing significant additional funding to priority projects across australia, including: we will stimulate local economies through an additional $1\u00a0billion for local governments nationwide under the local roads and community infrastructure program. we are also providing $2 billion for a new road safety program, as part of our commitment to delivering safe roads for all users.\u00a0 this additional investment builds on the $500 million we are already delivering for targeted road safety works. city deals our cities agenda has established the use of city deals as a way to deliver opportunities around australia for building stronger, better, and more liveable cities. across the nation, city deals are leveraging $16.8 billion in commitments, including more than $8 billion from the australian government, through a partnership approach with state, territory and local governments. in the lead up to this year\u2019s budget, we announced funding for some major city deal commitments. just last month we launched a new $1.5 billion dollar city deal between the commonwealth and western australian governments and the city of perth. this will bring government and private investment into the perth cbd, creating almost 10,000 jobs. the perth city deal will include the creation of the state\u2019s first inner-city university campus, with more than 9,200 staff and students. as well as upgrades to the waca, the perth concert hall and cycling and walking infrastructure. we also increased our funding commitment to the sydney metro \u2013 western sydney airport rail link, which is a centrepiece of the western sydney city deal. the new 23km metro railway will become the transport spine for western sydney, by connecting from st marys to the western sydney aerotropolis via the western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport. we are contributing $5.25 billion, the largest ever investment by an australian government in a public transport project.\u00a05.8km of extra tunnelling has been designed for the new line, with six stations proposed for stage one.\u00a0 early construction work is scheduled for later this year to meet our objective of having rail connected to western sydney international airport in time for the airport opening. there\u2019s 70 commitments under the western sydney city deal that will transform the region and along with the airport create 200,000 jobs for locals. all up, eight city deals have been agreed to date. they are a genuine partnership between the three levels of government and the community, with deals now operating in all states and the northern territory. in summary this was a budget which sets out our economic recovery plan for australia, taking into account the particular challenges and opportunities of the current pandemic. among the challenges is that australia\u2019s population growth is expected to slow to its lowest rate in over a hundred years. among the opportunities is a record level of funding for transport, road and rail infrastructure to generate aggregate demand and create jobs. \u00a0 our approach is squarely focused on supporting jobs and growth. this means bringing forward expenditure in our ten year pipeline of transport infrastructure projects. taken as a whole, this budget will set australia up well for a post-pandemic recovery. i\u2019m now happy to open the forum up to questions.

colleagues here. premier, i\u2019ve opened a lot of roads as the federal minister, but i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever seen such excitement as opening northconnex, and i can understand why. because this fixes one of the worst roads in australia \u2013 being pennant hills road \u2013 and it means, as you indicated, a daily commuter will save 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes in the afternoon every single day. that means that daily commuter over the course of the year will get a week of their life back as a result of this road. it is an absolute gamechanger like very few that we have seen in australia. so i also want to congratulate you, premier, and minister constance for the way that you have worked so constructively with the federal government on this project along with transurban. the federal government has contributed over $400 million to this project and its one element of the huge $110 billion infrastructure program which we have rolled out across the country. i equally want to say congratulations to transurban for leading the construction effort here. but importantly there\u2019s been hundreds of smaller businesses which have also been involved in construction efforts here, and 17,000 individuals who have been involved with it. so a very big thank you and congratulations to each of those 17,000 workers. and you will be immensely proud of this because it really will stand as a truly phenomenally good project over the course of time. i\u2019m a melburnian. it\u2019s great to be here in sydney. i can assure you, i quarantined for a couple of weeks and have been in canberra for a couple of weeks, so you\u2019re safe. but i\u2019ve got to say also just as a melburnian, being here in sydney and seeing how almost normal it is again is just a testament to the work which premier, you have led here. it almost pains me to say this but i wish that melbourne was a bit like sydney in this regard where we could be a bit more open in melbourne, too. but with this road it means that you\u2019ll be able to go from newcastle to melbourne without going through a single set of traffic lights. just an incredible achievement. so congratulations once again to all of those involved. it\u2019s been a great partnership between the federal government and the state government. well done everybody. gladys berejiklian: thank you, minister tudge. andrew constance:  well, alan, thanks for coming, and it\u2019s great to have you. but to the premier and my colleagues, and to everyone, this is a lifechanger. it\u2019s a lifechanger for millions of people. and we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that. i mean, millions of people are going to travel through this tunnel every year, getting home quicker, more time with your loved ones. for those who want to travel from newcastle to melbourne, i\u2019d say why, but, you know, at the same time, you\u2019re not going to experience a traffic light. and i want to particularly pay tribute to those local members and their communities who are, i think, probably 90 metres above us whose lives are going to change. those kids who were part of the ribbon-cutting today, there\u2019s 10 school communities set to benefit by not having trucks outside their school gates. the kids can cross the road much safer now. and, you know, when you take the most hated road in australia and it\u2019s now going to become one which is better for those communities with the northconnex tunnel underneath it, we can\u2019t lose sight of that. i mean, i know we talk about travel times, but let\u2019s also talk about safety \u2013 safety of our kids, the safety of our community. you know, we\u2019ve seen unfortunately 420 people injured on pennant hills road in the last five years. this is just going to improve that safety no end. so i want to thank everyone who\u2019s been involved in the project, i thank those communities for their patience. the big winners in this are going to be the central coast and western sydney, there\u2019s no doubt about that. but i just want to thank everyone for their patience. to scott charlton and the team at transurban, you know, you guys coming to government and saying, \u201cright, we need to build this, and the feds and the states work together,\u201d thank you for what you\u2019ve done. i mean, it\u2019s delivered thousands of jobs \u2013 17,000 people registered to work on this project. and it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time to be actually opening infrastructure at a time when we\u2019re dealing with a pandemic. so, scott, thank you for what you\u2019ve done here and thank you in terms of the risk that you\u2019ve taken, the vision that you brought to the project, and it\u2019s great that the federal and state governments have been able to work together. scott charlton:  thank you, premier; thank you, minister; and thank you minister tudge. we\u2019re so proud of transurban. this is actually almost a 10-year journey since we started this. i know we talked about the benefits and the premier and the ministers have talked about the benefits. i just want to thank the community for their patience. construction of infrastructure is hard, and hopefully once we see the benefits as we do when we provide parks and bike lanes and the amenity, we can hopefully turn big parts of pennant hills road back over to the community their patience and their time during the construction will be worth it. so i want to thank the community, and i particularly want to thank the boldness of the new south wales government. so we did come to them with an idea. they were able to sit down with us, work through, make sure obviously value for money for the state, its safety benefits, customer benefits. it\u2019s been a fantastic journey. so i just want to thank the new south wales government for your boldness. and this is actually being delivered 10 years earlier than would have been planned if it not been for the partnership with the state government, transurban and our partners as well \u2013 qic, canadian pension fund and all of the ll joint venture that built this. so, so many stakeholders, such a fantastic journey. just so proud. thank you. gladys berejiklian: it\u2019s a great day. well done. and i know many of the workers here want to celebrate the wonderful occasion that it is, which we\u2019ll get to do in a second. but i also just want to say very briefly that i can\u2019t express my deepest gratitude that this project is opening in a time when we are in a pandemic. overnight we had more than 12,000 people get tested. we [indistinct] of community transmission until 8 o\u2019clock last night. we had six in quarantine. but there has been one case since 8 o\u2019clock last night. it was another child at the trampoline centre, and health will be issuing further updates during the day. we please ask everybody, especially in southwestern sydney to watch the health updates during the day to make sure that the community transmission is stopped in its tracks. so thank you again, everybody, and pleased to take any questions. journalist:  [indistinct] gladys berejiklian: if the health experts give us the tick, we will be moving quickly. we don\u2019t want to have the border shut to victorians one day longer than it has. we\u2019ll rely on the advice. but unlike queensland and wa, who have been dragging their feet for months and months and months for no logical reason, we\u2019ve demonstrated in new south wales our capacity to be resilient, our capacity to get on top of outbreaks when they happen, but also our ability to keep pushing through with economic activity, which is really important. and projects like this remind us how important jobs are. come march next year when jobkeeper runs out, where will new south wales and australia be if we can\u2019t even move around our own country creating jobs, reuniting families and living as we should. we should be very proud as a nation, and minister tudge and the prime minister and the team have done an outstanding job as a nation supported by the states in dealing with this pandemic. let\u2019s live freely as australians. it\u2019s painful to me that new zealanders can come and go in new south wales comfortably but i can\u2019t go to queensland, i can\u2019t go to wa. and i don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. journalist:  [indistinct] gladys berejiklian: well, my message to all the premiers who continue to deny residents reuniting with each other or businesses to flourish is please just dig deep and think about the compassionate issues here. if there were health concerns i\u2019d be the first to say i understand your position. i mean, i\u2019ve had to be in that position with victoria, and i didn\u2019t want to be in that position. but we moved to disclose the border after consultation with the victorian premier and the prime minister. it wasn\u2019t a decision we took lightly or one that we wanted to do. and as soon as we can open that border we will. it could be a matter of weeks, depending on the health advice. but we certainly won\u2019t keep that border closed a day longer than we have to, because we have confidence in our system. we have confidence in our people. we have confidence in our health system. we have confidence in our police and service new south wales to work together to make sure we keep our citizens safe. journalist: [indistinct] gladys berejiklian: well, with gyms, you still need to make sure you have a covid mask. you still need to make sure equipment has to be cleaned. we assess all of the restrictions on a daily and weekly basis, and we feel that we do have covid-safe plans in place. but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t mean \u2013 i don\u2019t want to cast aspersions on those businesses that have been identified today \u2013 but what minister dominello and myself have been particularly vigilant about this week is the need for compliance, the need to make sure every business, no matter what type of business you are, stick to the covid-safe plans, have the qr code so that when there is an outbreak we can get in touch with people in minutes. that is so critical because when you get in touch with people within minutes you can warn them, they can isolate, they can get tested and we know that we can get on top of the virus. and the compliance levels have been great. you know, on the service new south wales we\u2019ve had a until kind of clicks in the last little while \u2013 half a million users. we want to increase that. we don\u2019t want to go down the path of making it compulsory for all businesses to have qr codes, but if we find take-up is a bit slower than what we\u2019d like, we may go down that path. but the important thing is that there are always exceptions. no matter how good a business is, we cannot forget \u2013 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s even important today \u2013 for everybody to be covid safe at all times \u2013 maintain your distance, hand sanitise, make sure you follow the rules. because no matter how covid safe any business is or any environment is, this virus is extremely contagious, and it\u2019s easy to forget that when our numbers are so low. but we have to be aware that this virus is extremely contagious and we have to be on our guard at all times. and that is what\u2019s really important. journalist:  [indistinct] gladys berejiklian: it\u2019s been illogical. and tasmania, i throw tasmania into that lump as well. i mean, a number of states have chosen to lump new south wales in with victoria, which has not been a common sense approach in my view. the two states have been vastly different in their approach and how they\u2019ve managed the pandemic. the is what it is, and i suspect the election cycle in both those states has had something to do with it. but i\u2019m the first one to suggest \u2013 i\u2019m cautious. i\u2019m the first one to suggest you should put safety first. but the lengths that those premiers have gone to is beyond the realm of logic. and unfortunately, as has been highlighted, it\u2019s hurting families, it\u2019s hurting individuals, it\u2019s hurting businesses, and it shouldn\u2019t be the case. as australians we should be able to move around freely and safely. and i urge all the premiers to consider that. i\u2019m certainly considering that in relation to victoria. and once premier andrews allows melburnians to mix with the rest of victoria then, you know, the countdown will start for new south wales as to when we take down our border. journalist:  [indistinct] there\u2019s a new south wales police constable now in isolation after working in a quarantine hotel. now he entered the room of a man who was quarantining. he then left the room and finished his shift at the local police station. now he\u2019s having to quarantine, [indistinct] close contacts. what do you say to that? [indistinct]? gladys berejiklian: look, i don\u2019t know the specifics of that case. but i\u2019ll say this: i\u2019ve been very open about the fact that we welcome 3,000 australians back through sydney \u2013 45 per cent from other states \u2013 every single week. we have 5,000 people in our hotels at any given time. is this a high-risk venture? absolutely. is it something we battle every day? absolutely. so this isn\u2019t an easy job, and victoria demonstrated how difficult it is, because their lack of systems in place around quarantining obviously led to their second wave. so i don\u2019t shy away from the fact that managing the quarantine system is extremely difficult. it\u2019s complex and, yes, you\u2019re going to have cases from time to time where people have to take extra precautions or where there could be cases spreading because of that. and, again, overnight we had six cases from overseas in our quarantine system. now that means health officials have to be involved, police, the federal forces, abf, adf. so this is a complex operation. i\u2019ve never for a second taken away from how complex it is, and i hope people appreciate really the burden that new south wales has carried during this process. but we\u2019ve done it because we think it\u2019s in the best interests of australia and the best interests of new south wales. that\u2019s why i\u2019ve also been saying to the other states, \u201cokay, you\u2019ve got your borders up, but at least take your fair share of residents coming back to australia.\u201d unfortunately, they haven\u2019t been. and so this is a constant reminder to us about how hard it is. we\u2019ve got our normal quarantining, we\u2019ve got our health quarantine. it\u2019s a major complex operation every time you welcome australians back, and we\u2019re doing 3,000 a week. journalist:  the report into the natural disaster [indistinct] is about to be released. [indistinct]? gladys berejiklian: look, absolutely. i don\u2019t think we can learn enough from those catastrophic bushfires. and i know minister constance lives with it daily in his community. and we\u2019ve been having a number of discussions within our government about how we can approach this. minister elliott, who is here, did an outstanding job in coordinating the government\u2019s response to the new south wales inquiry. and he is already putting a number of those plans in place. and i want to thank minister elliott for that. but obviously all of us have to learn more. and i look forward to reading the final report, which is i think being tabled today. looking forward to doing what we can as a state to adopt the recommendations there. and the last thing people want to see is important reports handed down and ignored. we\u2019ll do the opposite. we\u2019ll make sure we take on the learnings, because there\u2019s too much at stake. protecting lives and properties has to be an absolute priority, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do moving forward. journalist:  [indistinct] gladys berejiklian: liz, good question. we\u2019ve actually already started implementing a number of the recommendations from our own inquiry. we actually asked the two very highly qualified individuals who did our inquiry in new south wales to actually make sure they gave us the report ahead of our season. and, again, without pre-empting anything, we know how important the work of the rfs is, so we\u2019re actually moving our state emergency operation centre for covid out of the rfs this week to make sure that rfs can focus on natural disasters and we\u2019ll be relocating that elsewhere.

"wa\u2019s first trackless tram between scarborough beach and glendalough has been given a federally-funded boost with a $2 million business case set to commence within months. the initial proposal is set to extend for seven kms from the coast along scarborough beach road to stirling city centre, with connections through to the perth cbd on the existing heavy rail network at glendalough station. trackless tram technology does not require tracks and operates on existing roadways making them easier and less expensive to incorporate into traditional transport systems. minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the trackless tram technology had the potential to be expanded into public transport systems across the country. \u201cthis is ground breaking technology that has the potential to be rolled out across our cities,\u201d mr tudge said.\u00a0 \u201cbeing a fraction of the cost of traditional rail solutions it could enable a massive expansion of public transport, it is very exciting,\u201d minister tudge said. federal member for stirling, vince connelly mp, said that making transport more convenient and accessible will increase visitor numbers to scarborough foreshore and boost local businesses whilst also providing a new service for residents to reach glendalough station on their commute into the cbd.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cthe city of stirling\u2019s number one strategic priority for the last decade has been transforming the stirling city centre into perth\u2019s second cbd, focusing on the extension of stephenson avenue as the first stage. in the 2020 budget, the morrison government increased its support for this project from $65 million up to $82.5 million. \u201cthe next phase of this strategic plan is to link the stirling city centre, which includes the herdsman-glendalough, innaloo and osborne park precincts with the scarborough foreshore redevelopment using trackless tram technology. this will connect to the existing heavy rail at glendalough station ultimately linking the perth cbd to scarborough beach. \u201cbusinesses in the scarborough foreshore precinct are not operating at full capacity due to heavy congestion and lack of availability of parking. it is anticipated that improvement of transport options along scarborough beach road will create a \u2018development corridor\u2019 effect to attract new businesses, and the business case is an important first step towards this goal,\u201d mr connelly said. federal member for curtin, celia hammond mp, said the decision to allocate the funding reflects the needs of the local community along the border of her and mr connelly\u2019s electorates.\u00a0 \u201cover 15,000 people attend the scarborough sunset markets every thursday night and struggle with congestion and parking. the electrically-powered and rechargeable trams have the potential to reduce this congestion as well as improve air quality by lowering pollution. \u201cit is incredibly exciting to see the city of stirling leading the way on this new technology, which can be powered by renewable energy at recharge stations along the route. \u201cthe initial community consultation showed significant support for the tram initiative, but the business case process will be important in determining the specifics of how trackless tram technology works in the australian context,\u201d ms hammond said. city of stirling mayor, mark irwin, said work towards the trackless tram system is partly underway with the route already having been zoned for light rail years ahead of other localities in western australia. \u201clong-term, comprehensive local government planning is already approved, and land holders along the route have already ceded the road reserve land required to widen scarborough beach road and deliver the rapid-transit lanes required for the trackless tram system. \u201cthis has meant we were the first local government in western australia ready to receive these federal funds, and we look forward to proving up this concept in order to take the city forward into a new decade of prosperity,\u201d mayor irwin said. trackless tram technology

the life of the project. more than 75,000 motorists use the interchange daily and in 2017 it was ranked as perth\u2019s 13th most congested intersection. wanneroo road is a crucial arterial passenger route and alternative route to the mitchell freeway providing access between the perth central business district, joondalup and the north west corridor. premier mark mcgowan said he was pleased to see another government election commitment delivered. \u201cwe are continuing to deliver on our election commitments to create and support local jobs, while slashing travel times on our roads,\u201d the

recover from the covid-19 pandemic.\u201d western australian transport minister rita saffioti said this was part of a suite of upgrades the mcgowan government was delivering across the northern suburbs. \u201cthis project will help cut travel times, improve safety and traffic flow in our northern suburbs along with other recently completed projects such as the mitchell freeway southbound widening between vincent to cedric,\u201d ms saffioti said. \u201cwe have a huge raft of projects planned and underway across the northern suburbs including the yanchep rail extension, the wanneroo

companies, the one he heads-up had to stop or stall projects as the impact of covid-19 took hold. but by june the tide turned for vos constructions. under the launceston city deal, the company was awarded the contract to build part of the university of tasmania\u2019s inversek campus. as a result vos construction were able to shore up their workforce across northern tasmania. three months later its ceo says jobs have been saved and his business has had the confidence to employ three new apprentices. all thanks to one of the largest infrastructure projects in launceston\u2019s history. the $260 million relocation of the utas launceston campus is the centrepiece of the deal and the economic benefits for northern tasmania are immense. the first campus building is now coming out of the ground and will be completed by the end of next year. construction on the first elements of the campus, the library and student experience building and the new footbridge, is expected to create over 150 jobs. to date, 65 people have been employed on the project. while the importance of the morrison government\u2019s more than 85,000 jobs generated across our $100 billion pipeline of projects cannot be understated, it\u2019s when those huge numbers are broken down that the impact for local businesses like vos constructions can really be felt. it means a wage for an australian family who are bringing up their kids, who are paying off their home, who are having a go for australia and their local community. yesterday we launched the launceston city deal\u2019s third annual progress report and it contains similar success stories for tasmania\u2019s north. we don\u2019t need to tell locals about the remarkable transformation that has taken place since the deal was signed in 2017. progress can be seen everywhere. the university campus redevelopment is not only providing jobs now, but will attract 10,000 students annually by 2032 and support an ultimate target of 16,000 students and staff engaged annually on the new campus. all up, this once-in-a-generation project is expected to create around 430 jobs during the construction phase, with 225 jobs across teaching and support staff roles after completion. government and private investment is channeling $509 million into a broad range of initiatives that are also increasing jobs, improving the city\u2019s liveability and delivering educational opportunities. over 30 commitments are being progressed to deliver the city deal\u2019s vision making launceston one of australia\u2019s most liveable and innovative regional cities. by the end of this year, the pedestrian and cycle bridge across the north esk river is expected to be complete. next month celebrates two years of operation for the building launceston\u2019s apprenticeship pipeline projects initiative. over the past year, 26 new apprenticeships within the construction industry have been delivered through this initiative. since the deal was signed we have seen the youth unemployment rate in launceston drop from 19.2% (2015-2017) to 13.4% (2017-2019). to support indigenous employment, utas and taswater have both committed to a 3 per cent aboriginal employment target and 3 per cent aboriginal supplier use during the construction phase of the new campus and the upgrade to combine storm water and sewerage system. the city deal\u2019s river health action plan is reducing pollution in the tamar estuary so that people can enjoy a cleaner river and flora and fauna can thrive in the estuary. over 175 kilometres of waterways are being protected by local landholders. overall, our investments in the tamar will exclude around 12,000 head of cattle and 140,000 head of sheep from entering the river. this has significantly improved the water quality and helped with the broader health of the tamar estuary \u2013 the latest report card demonstrated higher water quality grades in all zones of the estuary in 2020 compared to 2018. three years into implementation of the city deal, we can count the benefits. launceston's gross regional product (grp) has improved from a low base, increasing by 1.2% year-on-year over the past 3 years. launceston\u2019s city deal is delivering results for the local community, boosting the economy and providing local job opportunities now and into the future. "], "rn-breakfast-interview-fran-kelly": ["12 October 2020", "fran kelly: well, with covid-19 still racing across europe and the us, prime minister scott morrison says australia will take a very cautious approach to reopening travel with the rest of the world. the indefinite closure of the international borders has crashed australia's immigration program, delivering the biggest hit to forecast population growth in more than a century. treasury now forecasts that more people will leave the country in the next two years than will arrive, which will have enormous consequences for the economy, already of course, mired in recession.\nalan tudge is the minister for population and cities, and acting immigration minister. minister, welcome back to breakfast. alan tudge: g\u2019day, fran. fran kelly: there will be one million fewer australians by the end of 2022 - that's based on forward predictions - one million fewer consumers, many, many fewer taxpayers. this will mean lower living standards for all australians, won't it? alan tudge: well, it certainly has a very big impact on our economy and on our gdp growth. population's been a very significant part of our economic growth story for more than a century, and we're now going to have the lowest population growth this financial year since world war one. as you said, it'll be 0.2 per cent this year, whereas normally it tracks at about 1.6 per cent. so, yes, it will have an impact on the economy, and that's why... fran kelly: can you put that in dollar terms, or at least gdp terms? what's the hit to gdp from a million fewer people here over two years? alan tudge: well, if you go from 1.6 per cent population growth to 0.2 per cent\npopulation growth, the rule of thumb is that that's about a 1.4 per cent hit to gdp. that means we have to make up for that growth in other ways, and particularly for a boost in the participation rate and boost in productivity. and that's why this budget is so important, because it does go to those things; it goes to jobs, it goes to business investment. and that's why we're still forecasting that next financial year gdp will still be 4.75 per cent. fran kelly: is that realistic, though? i mean, boosting productivity, boosting participation, that's really making up for what the pandemic has done, it's not really going to make up for the added increase of a lack of projection of one million fewer people. is there any sort of genuine economic reform on the plate? what's coming up? alan tudge: well, of course, and the prime minister's been through this, in terms of some of the very substantial economic reform, which is already underway. but the budget itself of course contains ... fran kelly: like what? alan tudge: the budget itself contains significant reform in and of itself, and in particular, in relation to the tax cuts. the tax cuts, which have a flattening of the curve, create further incentives for people to work more. and i know people, some people, will dismiss that, but it's very important. and once you introduce the further stages as well, then it has a further impact. the very significant impact of being able to make investments and write them off all in one year will create a massive boost for investment, and that's why the business community has been so strong in relation to that.\nand overall, treasury does expect - and they're the ones that do the forecast - is that the result of this is that we will see growth next year of 4.75, and then 2.75 and then three the years after that. so, despite the fact that population will be considerably lower, we still are forecasting quite considerable growth in the next few years. fran kelly: have you told that to the construction sector? i mean, demand for housing according to the property council could be cut by up to 230,000 dwellings. the property council wants a roadmap for restarting migration as a top priority for national cabinet, and it wants an aggressive marketing campaign to sell australia as a safe and healthy destination for prospective migrants. is there any work being done at this stage on trying to restore immigration once the pandemic is over, or the borders are open anyway? alan tudge: well, first up, let me just address the property issue, because you're right; the property sector is dependent upon population growth, that almost goes without saying. it's why we've spent so much time doing the homebuilder program, which has had a massive stimulatory impact. the first home buyers scheme, which has also had an impact. and also, why we've invested, or one of the further reasons, why we've invested so much in the civil construction area, because it will mop up some of the demand which might not be in the residential construction area. so there are things... fran kelly: okay. but meanwhile, is any work being done... alan tudge: there are things that we have put in place, fran, in relation to that. and that's been acknowledged, particularly by the master builders association. in relation to migration, generally, of course, we are thinking very deeply about that. but you've got to understand that a lot of our migration program is actually what's called demand driven, and that means, for example, that once the borders are open you will only be able to sponsor a person in if you're an employer, if you can't find an australian to do the work. and if there's more australians available to do the job, then there may well be fewer opportunities for sponsorship to occur. now, that's why, even if the borders open immediately tomorrow, the numbers might be slightly lower. but having said that, we are still projecting that in four or five years' time, it gets somewhere back to where they were in previous years. fran kelly: what about, i mean could you, you could still invite migrants in at the moment, bring people into australia, isolate them for two weeks. not in the hotel system, they're already overwhelmed with australians wanting to come home, but maybe christmas island or northern immigration detention centre in darwin. you could issue the invitation, see who wants to come and manage it that way. have you thought- are you thinking about that? alan tudge: well, the quarantine system is the speed limit, if you like. and obviously there's only a certain number of slots available there, and - fran kelly: well we haven't got the northern immigration detention centre open or christmas island open for this purpose - the government could do that. are you considering it? alan tudge: well, the states are responsible for the quarantining arrangements and we've put some pressure on them... fran kelly: no. but the federal government can move on christmas island, for instance, and it could work with northern territory on the northern immigration detention centre. alan tudge: well, the states with the national cabinet has agreed for the states to be responsible for the quarantine arrangements, and we put some pressure on them to increase the number of beds they have available. but you've still got a state like victoria where there's zero quarantine beds which are open right now. fran kelly: sure. alan tudge: at the moment, and typically you'd have say about a third of all migrants go to victoria - so that becomes an issue. clearly, the victorian government still doesn't have confidence in its quarantine arrangements. so that becomes, in some respects, the speed limit on it. and that's why we're forecasting that the numbers will still be quite considerably lower over the next few years, but then they do come back in about year four and year five.\n\u00a0\nfran kelly: what about the number of refugees? australia is facing a deficit of one million people \u2013 projection - as we've just been discussing, but at the same time the federal government in the budget announced it'd slashed the refugee intake by 5000 places. how does that make any humanitarian or practical economic sense? alan tudge: well, the number this year will be 13,750, which is actually an increase on what it was last year. last year's figure came in at 13,170, and... fran kelly: but when we're talking last year, are we talking financial year? does that take into account the number down because of the pandemic? alan tudge: it does, and that was the outcome... fran kelly: so, that's not a real - that's not a real litmus test then, is it? alan tudge: well, it still is because the pandemic is still ongoing, fran. i'm simply pointing out that last year was 13,170 was the actual numbers that came in. and this year we're forecasting will be 13,750 - so a slight increase on what it was last year. fran kelly: but why? i'm asking you why? i mean, there's no shortage of displaced people and refugees in desperate need of a permanent safe haven. australia could do with more people living here and spending here. why not bring in 5000 more and bring it up to the cap that was in place - over 18000. why cap it at 13,750? alan tudge: well, we'll still be the third most generous country in the world with an absolute... fran kelly: yeah, but that's not my question. why have you decided to cap it and make that cap 5000 lower? alan tudge: well, i mean, i've addressed this. first up, that it's actually an increase in what it was last year. second up... fran kelly: but it's a decrease on our cap. alan tudge: ...that all migration is down considerably, fran. we're going to have, for the first time ever, more people leaving the country than coming into the country - we'll have the first time ever that situation in 75 years, sorry first time in 75 years that will be the case. so, migration is down across the board, and yet at the same time the humanitarian intake will be slightly up on what we actually had last financial year and will still be... fran kelly: yeah. but, minister, that's disingenuous. migration is down because that's a free choice. humanitarian intake is different - as i say, there are tens of thousands of people in unhcr camps waiting for people to take them. why doesn't australia honour the commitment it had made beforehand? why not? alan tudge: migration is down because we've closed the borders, fran. and as i said... fran kelly: yeah, i know. but if we're bringing in 13,750 people anyway, why not bring in 18,000? alan tudge: and as i said, the speed limit becomes the quarantine arrangements. and so consequently, overall migration is a fraction of what it has been in previous years and all migration is being impacted by that. fran kelly: so the decision to decrease the humanitarian intake is the speed limit of the quarantine, is it? alan tudge: well as i said, we'll still be the third most generous country in the world on an absolute basis, in terms of our humanitarian intake, and it will still be a slight increase on what it was last year, fran. fran kelly: okay. alan tudge: and it's also in keeping with the fact that overall migration is down across the board and the pandemic continues. we reserve the right, as we do each and every year, to reset what the humanitarian program might look like for the following 12 months - we do that in the budget each year. for this year it will be... fran kelly: but we've banked, but the budget has banked a billion dollar saving over four years. alan tudge: and for this year it will be 13,750. and if next year a different decision is made, then it will they made in the budget context. fran kelly: minister, thank you very much for joining us.\u00a0 alan tudge: thanks very much, fran. fran kelly: alan tudge is the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure, and the acting minister for immigration.

barriers that can reduce accidents caused by running off the road or swerving into the wrong lane and rumble strips to alert drivers and riders that they are moving out of their lane. this additional investment builds on the $500 million we are already delivering for targeted road safety works. to monitor and evaluate our progress in this area, the morrison-mccormack government is also investing $5.5 million to establish a\u00a0national road safety data hub. the data hub will establish the first nationally available road safety data collection to assess the effectiveness of road safety efforts by all australian governments as we move towards the nationally agreed target of zero fatalities and serious injuries by 2050. the pandemic has hit australia everywhere and every region needs support. local councils understand the immediate needs in their communities. our community-led recovery plan empowers local governments nation-wide to deliver roads and community infrastructure. this will build shovel-ready local priorities, supporting local jobs and local business. the government is focused on delivering priorities for local areas as part of australia\u2019s road to recovery. our investments will draw on local businesses to stimulate local economies through an additional $1 billion for local governments for the\u00a0local roads and community infrastructure program.\u00a0this builds on the initial $500 million announced in may 2020. this investment, together with the new road safety program will support around 10,000 jobs over the life of the projects. the government is building on its existing investment in water infrastructure projects with an additional $2 billion in funding for projects through the national water infrastructure development fund. this more than doubles the fund to a total of $3.5 billion. the additional funding will deliver increased water security, build resilience in our regions, deliver jobs and grow our critical agriculture sector. the fund will become a 10 year rolling program of priority water infrastructure investments, demonstrating our commitment to supporting and investing in australia\u2019s regional economies over the long term. this will help increase water security in areas where extensive irrigated agriculture already exists, while also helping unlock new agricultural regions, especially in australia\u2019s north. this long-term focus will help identify and build the dams, weirs, pipelines, water recycling plants and other projects that will deliver the national water grid \u2013 a series of region-specific systems that will help secure reliable supplies of water for rural and regional australia now and into the future. the government will continue to work closely with state and territory government partners, informed by a strong scientific evidence base, to identify, plan and invest in water infrastructure projects across the country that will deliver the next generation of water infrastructure through the national water grid. the government\u2019s ongoing commitment to the delivery of city deals in townsville, darwin, western sydney, hobart, launceston, geelong and adelaide will help drive recovery in our cities and make them better places to live. the government will provide $327.5 million to support projects under the new perth city deal that will focus on reactivating and revitalising the perth cbd so that more people can live, work, learn and play in the city centre. the new deal will guarantee a collaborative approach and a shared vision with federal, state and local governments working together. the perth city deal is expected to deliver almost 10,000 jobs over the next 10 years. the 2020\u201321 budget continues to build a strong regional australia and includes a number of measures that respond to the unique way regions have been affected by the events of 2020. this budget ensures regions which are seeing strong population growth have the services and jobs they need, that regions in transition are supported to adapt to new circumstances and build resilience and investments for all communities to make sure they continue to be great places to work and live. funding will flow directly to support stronger, more resilient regions through the following initiatives: deputy prime minister\u00a0\u2013 joanne williamson 0418 475 668 | dean shachar 0418 202 860 minister tudge\u00a0\u2013 michael bennett 0434 782 923 \u00a0 australian government funding for projects is typically provided on the basis of a contribution of up to 80 per cent of the total cost in regional areas and up to 50 per cent of the total cost in urban areas. the remainder is to be provided by state and territory governments, local governments and/or the private sector. key projects listed do not include the new road safety program, local roads and community infrastructure program, road maintenance funding, black spot projects, bridges renewal program, heavy vehicle safety and productivity program, roads to recovery or untied grants. *denotes new commitments in the 2020-21 budget. sub-program key projects total australian government funding from 2013-14 ($m)

removal of the three level crossings along the inner armadale line. today\u2019s rfp calls for contractors to remove crossings at oats street, mint street and welshpool road. at the same time planning continues for the removal of three more crossings at william street, wharf street and hamilton street. the level crossings will be closed and replaced with elevated rail. the successful contractor must also demonstrate how they will achieve good design outcomes for new public spaces under the elevated rail. the plan follows work commencing last year on the denny avenue level crossing removal project in kelmscott, with a rail over road underpass at davis road being constructed. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the crossing removals were targeted projects to deliver tangible benefits for the people of perth. \u201cwe are prioritising projects in perth that will bust congestion but that are also going to drive the wa economy and deliver local jobs,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cthese level crossings removals will do both.\u201d western australian transport minister rita saffioti said the removal of level crossings along the inner armadale line was a key mcgowan government election commitment. \u201cmetronet is the largest public transport investment in perth\u2019s history and the rfp process gives contractors the opportunity to be involved in delivering these exciting projects,\u201d she said. \u201cthis project will help support the western australian economy through covid-19 while also ensuring we are building the infrastructure needed for tomorrow. \u201cthis year alone we have seven metronet projects under construction creating thousands of local jobs and opportunities for small local businesses.\u201d federal member for swan steve irons said he had been campaigning for the removal of the level crossings for years. \u201ci\u2019m pleased we have been able to secure funding for this important project that will create and support local jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cthe opening of today\u2019s request for proposals gives local contractors the opportunity to get involved with these works.\u201d state member for victoria park ben wyatt said the removal of the three level crossings was one of his key election commitments. \u201cremoving these level crossings help reduce frustrations for commuters in the area who can be stuck waiting for up to three trains to pass at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cit is also a unique and extraordinary opportunity for the local community to have their say about the surrounding area and what they would like to see.\u201d up to 2.8 kilometres of elevated rail could be laid along the inner armadale line, providing more opportunities for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists to safely cross the rail corridor while also creating safer roads, quieter neighbourhoods and new connections between communities. it will also remove the dreaded boom gates, reducing the amount of minutes spent by commuters sitting at level crossings. currently oats street boom gates are closed 233 times a day for up to 1 minute 33 seconds per closure meaning it is down for up to six hours daily.\u00a0 a contract for the removal of the level crossings is expected to be awarded in 2021. the $415 million inner armadale line level crossing removal is jointly funded by the australian and western australian governments. mr tudge - michael bennett 0434 782 923 ms saffioti - caitlin goddard 0437 234 249 "], "transcript-abc-melbourne-interview-virginia-trioli": ["05 October 2020", "virgina trioli: big day tomorrow for the federal government and really for all of australia because this is one of the most significant federal budgets that will ever be handed down. what\u2019s the solution that you come up with to try and get a country through the recession that has hit us as a result of the pandemic? it\u2019s a huge ask. and the story that will have to be told by the treasurer and the solutions that will have to be found are very, very serious ones. alan tudge is the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure and, of course, the member for aston, and he joins you now. minister tudge, good morning, good to talk to you. alan tudge: good morning, virginia. virginia trioli: $1.1 billion for victorian transport infrastructure will be announced tomorrow night. take us through it. alan tudge: yeah, that\u2019s right, and that will support 4,000 jobs, and it\u2019s largely regional projects that we\u2019re announcing. the next stage of the warrnambool rail upgrade, the next stage of the shepparton rail upgrade, bringing forward some money for the south geelong\u2019s waurn ponds rail, as well as a bunch of smaller scale projects in melbourne itself. the main focus, though, is on projects which can get going immediately in order to create those jobs as quickly as possible. but it\u2019s exciting for victoria, 4,000 jobs will be the result out of this announcement. virginia trioli: do we have the workers, though, here in victoria to fulfil those jobs and to take those places now? australia\u2019s heading for zero net migration. will we have the workers here? alan tudge: absolutely, and particularly in victoria where unemployment is still going up because of the restrictions. i mean, we\u2019ve got an abundance of labour at the moment, unfortunately, and hence the focus of the budget tomorrow is squarely going to be on jobs. how do we generate more jobs for australians? and, to be honest, particularly here in victoria where every other jurisdiction has got jobs coming back as restrictions ease. unfortunately here in victoria, because of the restrictions, we\u2019re still losing jobs. virginia trioli: so when the treasurer, josh frydenberg, said that victoria needed to get on with it and do more in infrastructure, when he said that over the last couple of days, to try and get the state moving, what exactly did he think was not getting done here? what did he want to see? alan tudge: listen, one of the biggest ones that obviously we\u2019ve been pushing for, for some time has been the east west link where we have $4 billion still sitting there as a contingent liability wanting to be spent. and that\u2019s the entire public funding for that massive project which would support another 4,000 people. virginia trioli: yes, of course, but the federal government and the treasurer himself have accepted that there is a difference of opinion on that they want to get it done but the state government here doesn\u2019t. so putting that to one side because that\u2019s accepted as a difference of opinion, it\u2019s not going to happen. alan tudge: but the treasurer did mention that particular project specifically. and that was pre-pandemic. we haven\u2019t had this discussion since, and when you have unemployment which is going to be above 10 per cent, possibly higher here in victoria, which is not seen since the early 1990s, then we need to re-examine some of these things. and if you\u2019ve got a massive project such as the east west link, which is sitting there where we will fund the entire public contribution towards it, then why not re-examine that. i think that\u2019s what the treasurer was getting at. virginia trioli: sure, but, as i say, it is sort of a bit a pointless discussion because this government won\u2019t do it, it says. so putting that to one side, give me another one. what else is missing? alan tudge: well, the rowville rail, we\u2019ve got half a billion dollars sitting on the table. we\u2019d still like to see that underway. i\u2019ve been having good discussions with jacinta allan the transport minister here in victoria for a long time now. we\u2019ve got a lot of great projects underway, and these projects which we\u2019re announcing today have all been negotiated with her and with the state government, so that they can get started immediately. they\u2019re all on their wish list and jointly we want to get these projects done. we\u2019ve got a lot of more projects that we are doing together than we have differences on. but, of course, there are some differences in some of these examples that i\u2019ve just provided. virginia trioli: yeah, i mean, look, there\u2019s not many. the reason i ask the question is that of course we had the long list that the premier enumerated over the weekend of what has been done here in victoria. it just seems like it was a smack without much substance, given that, as the premier listed, what were the figures that we\u2019ve had 38 level crossings taken out, eight during the pandemic, two more railway stations, halfway point in the tunnel of the metro tunnelling. it\u2019s hard to argue, as josh frydenberg has, that the state hasn\u2019t been moving. alan tudge: there\u2019s certainly been some great projects which have been underway in victoria. but there are some projects which we would absolutely like to get underway, and josh frydenberg was making that point. particularly when you\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, when you\u2019re in the state which is still losing jobs whereas nearly every other state is gaining jobs back because of the easing of restrictions, then we need to be doing everything we possibly can. when you\u2019ve got projects such as the east west link, which are there they\u2019re ready, fully, massive projects, $4 billion ready to go. virginia trioli: yeah, i get the passion. i get your passion, but politically it\u2019s just a non-starter. alan tudge: the treasurer obviously is very keen to see the glenferrie road level crossing done as well. so there\u2019s many other projects. virginia trioli: well, they\u2019re all on the list of level crossings. now, look, if victoria is the biggest drag on the economy right now, as the treasurer has said, why is new south wales getting more than double what victoria is getting? they\u2019re getting $2.7 billion. don\u2019t you put the money where it\u2019s most needed? alan tudge: you would have heard the premier yesterday, who said that they were seeking $1.3 billion from the federal government, and today we\u2019ve announced every single one of those projects to be delivered with the exception of one, which is the murray darling basin rail plan and we\u2019re still examining that one. we\u2019re obviously open to it, but we\u2019re not announcing that today. but otherwise we\u2019re delivering on the things which the premier has asked for. virginia trioli: no, look, i\u2019ll just jump in there. i get that. but, if as a federal government and the federal government and josh frydenberg in particular has been at pains to say that victoria is the drag on the country getting back and getting back into the black, if that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t you pour everything where it\u2019s needed? why 2.7 billion in the state that\u2019s actually putting some jobs on whereas this is the place that\u2019s not? alan tudge: so, well, a few points there. firstly, we are absolutely funding the things which the state government has requested that can be done immediately, and that is the criteria. second, when you actually look over the next 10 years of the funding which we are providing to victoria, we are providing about 30 per cent to victoria whereas the population share is about 25 per cent. and then the third point i\u2019d say is that when you look at all of the pandemic funding that we have provided, and this has been an enormous sum, including $100 billion of direct financial support to australians, again, close to 30 per cent of that funding has been going to victorians. whereas the share on a population basis would be closer to a quarter. so on each of those bases victoria is absolutely getting funding, and it will continue to do so. i mean, by the end of this year, virginia, 60 per cent of the entire jobseeker program funding will be going to victorians. virginia trioli: okay. well, look, the trouble, of course, when we get to speak to you now these days, minister tudge, is that it\u2019s very difficult to take seriously what is said by a man who\u2019s been found by the federal court to have engaged in conduct which can only be described as criminal in relation to, of course, to depriving an asylum seeker of his liberty and leaving him in detention for five days. so the question still hangs over your head, alan tudge, about why you believe you can still hold down the job that you do when you\u2019ve been found by one of the highest courts in the land to have engaged in conduct that is criminal? alan tudge: well, i strongly reject those assertions made in commentary by the judge. virginia trioli: i don\u2019t think you get to reject assertions or findings by a court. there\u2019s not assertions, they are findings by a court. now, i don\u2019t know if you get to reject those. alan tudge: they were comments by a particular judge, which i strongly reject. we\u2019re looking at our appeal rights presently. virginia trioli: i wish we all got to reject findings by a judge, but i don\u2019t think we do, and i don\u2019t think ministers are above the law there. alan tudge: and i think from memory you\u2019re a lawyer yourself, virginia. virginia trioli: no, i\u2019m not. alan tudge: apologies. but it was commentary of this particular judge. virginia trioli: since when do we describe a finding by judges as commentary? that\u2019s curious. alan tudge: if i can finish. he actually found in favour of our appeal. it was an appeal from the administrative appeals tribunal to the particular court that made some comments that i completely and utterly reject, and we\u2019re looking at our appeal rights. the key thing here, and this is important in terms of the facts of this case, it involved an individual who had arrived unlawfully who had committed a very serious, violent offence and was imprisoned as a result. virginia trioli: we\u2019re not pressing that matter; it\u2019s the findings of the judge that you acted unlawfully. alan tudge: and consequently the government made a decision, to not grant that visa \u2013 virginia trioli: and you feel comfortable to stay in your position, do you? alan tudge: if i could finish \u2013 virginia trioli: you only have a few seconds minister. alan tudge: consequently, because of his violent criminal actions, the government made a decision to not grant him a visa, and that has been consistent with many other decisions that we have made to not give violent criminals visas. virginia trioli: we have run out of time because we are against the news but we will let the listeners draw their own conclusions minister, but i\u2019m glad you joined us today, thank you. alan tudge: thank you very much virginia. virginia trioli: minister tudge who is the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure.

["05 October 2020", "neil mitchell: federal budget tomorrow, meaning cuts, meaning spending which i think we need. today the federal government is claiming a new 1.1 billion dollars investment in victoria, in building. it's mostly regional, a lot of it's regional. barwon heads road, shepparton rail upgrade stage 3, warrnambool upgrade stage 2. on the line is the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge. good morning. alan tudge: good morning, neil. neil mitchell: where's the airport rail link? alan tudge: it'll be coming. we've got $5 billion on the table as you know, and it's scheduled to start in 2022. we certainly need this. it should have been built probably two or three decades ago, neil, but we will get it done starting in 2022. neil mitchell: just to get it clear. none of this is dependent on the billion dollars that you were debating over the east west link. alan tudge: no, no. that's another project which obviously we want to get done and we have the full public funds set aside to do this project, but the state government is resisting to do it unfortunately. it would create another 4,000 jobs immediately if they decided to get under way with it. neil mitchell: but what we're announcing then are not new projects. you've pledged money here before. it's a matter of you're now going to pay a larger slice of what the state government was putting in, aren't you? isn't that how it works? alan tudge: these are all new projects that we're announcing today. now some of them, for example the shepparton rail upgrade is stage 3 of the rail upgrade but it's still a huge amount of money, $300\u00a0million going in. that work will begin next year and be completed a couple of years thereafter. just making that line, for example, more reliable, safer and more resilient for weather events and the like. neil mitchell: that wasn't funded until today, or tomorrow? alan tudge: yes, that's correct. this is all new money. we've had money going into that line in the past. this is new additional money going into that rail line. as you said, going to many other regional rail lines. in part, we have focused on the regions today and tomorrow in the budget because they're projects which can get started more quickly whereas sometimes in the city they take a little bit longer to get started. nevertheless, there still are a bunch of projects, smaller scale ones, that we're also funding in the budget tomorrow as well. neil mitchell: but i was looking at some of them. it seems the state government contribution has been cut back and your contribution has been increased, is that correct? alan tudge: we've not had any contribution towards these projects to date. these are projects which we've been in discussions with the state government about over the last, you know, couple of months, myself particularly with jacinta allan and with the deputy prime minister. they're the things they wanted to see supported. we have agreed to those so that they can get cracking. the most important thing about all of this is that it will create 4,000 jobs. and we desperately need these jobs. neil mitchell: when? alan tudge: all of them have been decided, all of them have been chosen because they can begin immediately or certainly within about 12 months. obviously we're funding projects which want to get cracking soon and that's how these have been designed. neil mitchell: who will choose \u2011 who will manage them, state or federal? alan tudge: so the state government will manage all of these projects, yes. neil mitchell: who will choose the contractors? alan tudge: the state government. neil mitchell: will it be open to international contractors like the chinese companies they love using? alan tudge: those decisions will be made by the state government, but as you know we're introducing a foreign relations bill, which once passed, which we expect later this year, will mean that no agreement, which is contrary to australia\u2019s foreign policy, will be able to go ahead. neil mitchell: but how will it be contrary to australian's foreign policy to say, \"we're going to employ a chinese construction company to do the barwon heads road upgrade\", that wouldn't fall under that category, surely? alan tudge: each individual case would need to be assessed against the act, and it depends on the nature of the particular company. now, ideally \u2011 not ideally, i certainly would like to see an australian company do that work employing australian people on the ground. i mean we've got great australian construction companies. neil mitchell: but there's no strings attached. i mean if the state government, which is in love with china, if the state government wants to bring in international companies to do it, they can, correct, and you still provide the money? alan tudge: well there's international companies who are based here already, acciona for example, a spanish company. neil mitchell: john holland, yes. alan tudge: john holland, et cetera. so they do some of the big work already. we provide the money; the state does make the selection. but i do put this rider on, because this has been really important for the federal government, is that state governments once this foreign relations bill has been passed will not be able to enter agreements which undermine our foreign relations, undermine our national interest in foreign policy. neil mitchell: yeah, but i'm worried about two things. one, where the profits go. but second, it's been argued with some of the chinese projects in particular it's sent jobs offshore. can you be sure that every dollar of this will be spent employing and getting work for australians? alan tudge: i can assure that every dollar that is spent will be going to people in australia, absolutely. all of these projects, i mean the nature of construction projects is that they have to be done here on the ground. whereas of course if you're buying a new tv or something that manufacturing can occur somewhere else. neil mitchell: okay. is this dependent on \u2011 as much of the budget is really \u2011 is this dependent on the discovery of a vaccine? alan tudge: no, it's not. these will go ahead regardless and, you know, one of the good things that has occurred across the country, and this has been different actually compared to somewhere like new zealand, is that the entire construction sector has managed to be maintained throughout the pandemic, even here in victoria, which has obviously had the most severe restrictions anywhere in the country. these projects will still go ahead. we're providing the bulk of the money for them and we want to get those jobs under way. neil mitchell: i understand you're providing the bulk of the money but on what i read the budget is predicated on a vaccine being established and obviously if that doesn't come in then the bottom lines not as healthy, does this money come through in the same time? alan tudge: well the money will absolutely come through at the same time. neil mitchell: what's that? how long before it's actually on the table and we're digging holes? alan tudge: well the money will be there as of budget night and as soon as construction is underway that's when our money flows. the federal money always flows according to the construction schedule. we don't give it upfront and say, \"good luck with it\". we always hold it back. when you reach the milestones, we hand over the money. neil mitchell: nothing for the north east link or the metro tunnel, suburban rail loop. why? alan tudge: north east link we've already got from the federal perspective $1.7 billion committed for that and the state government and private contributions are funding the rest. that's ready to go. that's 10,000 jobs and the early works are under way. neil mitchell: yes. alan tudge: massive project. neil mitchell: suburban rail loop, no? alan tudge: suburban\u00a0loop, we had offered money in the past and it was rejected by the state government, so from memory we had offered a billion dollars. but we've got money in so many other projects here in victoria, as we do around the country, and infrastructure is so desperate right now because it creates local jobs and that's what this entire budget is going to be about. neil mitchell: how much of this is going to be spent on business cases and studies as distinct from digging holes? alan tudge: in most of these projects have already had the work undertaken to do the preparatory work, if you like.\u00a0 there are one or two projects, which are specifically funding for business cases, for example, further work on the electrification of the wyndham vale and melton lines, which obviously become important, and they'll be

before rising again in the mid-2020\u2019s and settling to a long-term average by 2030. the first research report commissioned by the federal government\u2019s centre for population provides a road map for australia\u2019s population composition in the post-covid\u201119 years. a projection of australia\u2019s future fertility rate forecasts the fertility rate will drop to 1.59 babies per woman in 2021 compared with 1.70 babies per woman in 2018 and then transition to a long-term average of 1.62 in 2030. this expert analysis by leading demographer professor peter mcdonald projects that australian families will have fewer children in the coming two years. over the period to 2024, the fertility rate is expected to climb back to 1.69 as the majority of women who delayed having their first or next baby resume their plans. the fertility rate will then return to its longer-term level of 1.62 from 2030 as the deferral trend normalises. the report concludes that families are likely to defer having their first, or next, baby in the current economic climate. it also states that history has shown fertility tends to decline in periods of economic uncertainty, with the impact of covid-19 now being felt across the economy. minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the figures paint a picture of australia\u2019s population composition on the other side of covid\u201119. \u201cour population growth will be the lowest since ww1 as a result of covid,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cstopping migration has been the main contributor to this but the fertility rate has also dropped which tends to happen in times of economic uncertainty. these projections outlined in this report will inform our population planning into the future at both a federal and state level.\u201d the full report is available at https://population.gov.au/downloads/mcdonaldfertilityprojections.pdf. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0year\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0aus\u00a0

"construction is underway on stage 3 of the broadway duplication project. the $2.2 million, stage 3 will duplicate the broadway between elmina ave and the westgrove dr and the broadway roundabout. it will also reconfigure the elmina ave and galatea pass intersections and upgrade the existing roundabout at westgrove dr and the broadway intersection to a dual-lane roundabout. around 16,000 vehicles use the broadway every day. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the 4-stage project was part of the morrison government\u2019s urban congestion fund that targets local traffic headaches. \u201cas each stage of works wraps up, more and more local people will be getting home sooner and safer,\u201d mr\u00a0tudge said. \u201cwe are continuing to get

investing in critical shovel-ready projects along the great eastern and bussell highways, exmouth road and toodyay road while simultaneously delivering a dedicated road safety package for life-saving improvements right across regional wa,\u201d mr mccormack said. \u201coverall this package is estimated to support more than 1,000 jobs during construction, which is absolutely fantastic news for locals and communities across the state. \u201cby investing in critical infrastructure projects across the country, we are doing more than just supporting local jobs and businesses at this critical time. we are investing in our future beyond covid-19 by delivering lasting infrastructure which will kick-start our economic recovery and benefit australians for years to come.\u201d western australia premier mark mcgowan said the regional state road safety improvement program would see the two governments invest $100 million across the state to deliver improvements over the next year. \u201cthe road safety improvement program will widen, seal or install audio-tactile line markings on more than 20 regional routes right across the state to reduce run-off-road crashes,\u201d he said. \u201cthese works will improve road safety, saving lives and bolstering the resilience of the state\u2019s road networks, which is absolutely critical for our regional roads. \u201cthe package will immediately help support economic activity and wa jobs, and is another sign of the state and commonwealth governments working collaboratively in the interests of western australians.\u201d senator cormann further said that bringing forward these key infrastructure projects is part of $13.8 billion in infrastructure funding for western australia that the federal government has committed to transport infrastructure projects to date. \u201cthe federal government is committed to projects that get west australians home sooner and safer. but particularly as we look to grow the west australian economy on the other side of the covid-19 crisis, we want to guarantee work for local trades and keep money flowing through local businesses throughout the construction phase and beyond,\u201d senator cormann said. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the funding injection would also deliver shovel-ready fixes to thomas road. \u201cfor perth motorists that includes creating dual lanes for an extra kilometre between the kwinana freeway and nicholson road and a much-needed intersection upgrade,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cthomas road is used by around 19,000 vehicles every single day and this funding means shovels will be in the ground sooner to support local jobs and the economy.\u201d western australian minister for transport rita saffioti said the funding injection would support local jobs, businesses and the economy while providing lasting infrastructure to help the state bounce back as covid-19 restrictions ease. \u201cthis funding injection will help us start work on even more critical regional road infrastructure including the dualling of bussell highway, upgrades to key tourism roads in exmouth and key freight roads through toodyay. \u201cthese projects will support our local regional economies, creating and supporting local jobs whilst also improving safety.\u201d the jointly funded package is supported by investments from the commonwealth ($176 million) and wa government ($47 million).

billion dollars to immediately start work on 15 priority infrastructure projects. the projects will be fast tracked to stimulate growth and support thousands of jobs as australia comes out of the covid crisis. works include the inland rail from melbourne brisbane, the olympic dam extension in south australia, emergency water projects in new south wales, and road rail and iron ore projects in wa. minister for urban infrastructure, alan tudge joins me from canberra. minister, welcome the programme, thanks for joining us. alan tudge: good day kochie. david koch:  and what are some of the major projects that are ready to go right around the country? alan tudge: we announcing today, two things. one being an additional $1.5 billion of new money to get smaller scale projects going around the country this year to create jobs. then secondly as your introduction said, we are announcing 15 mega projects that we want to get going more quickly. now, these mega projects constitute $72 billion worth of investment and will unlock 66,000 jobs and we want to absolutely accelerate the time frame to get those going so that we can realise those jobs more quickly. david koch:  okay, so what's the criteria that you use to choose these projects? alan tudge: to choose the mega projects, one being that they\u2019re huge job multipliers, and two being that they are ready to go in terms of that they've got state and federal commitments. the money is locked in and now it's just going through the approvals process. we want to accelerate that approvals process so that we can unlock those jobs dividends david koch: it's a big shopping list. it reminds me that tv series utopia - doesn't it? with all these projects coming together. the prime minister- alan tudge: no that's unfair, kochie. i mean, we have mega projects going the whole time across australia, but these are ones, which are ready, and we want to get these going more quickly to unlock those jobs. in the meantime, we still have hundreds of other jobs and hundreds of other projects going on. david koch:  yeah, now the prime minister will deliver the state of the nation conference in canberra this morning. also announcing the next steps on deregulation. how important is that? alan tudge: this becomes critical because so many of these larger scale projects can take three or four years before they actually get going. and we want to reduce that time frame in half. now, we want to do this in a number of ways. one, we want to put more resources up front into the assessment process. two, to reduce the duplicative effort between state and federal governments and three, to actually do some of the processes if you like in parallel rather than sequentially. and if we do that, we get the projects going more quickly and that means jobs more quickly. david koch: and the states are on board with that? alan tudge: the states are 100 percent on board. everybody is committed to getting these jobs going fast. david koch: so, no fighting between the feds of the states - that will be good. all right, minister. sounds exciting, appreciate the time. alan tudge:  thanks very much.

and, second, that they are ready, they have the funding connected to it, and both levels of government want to get them going. sabra lane: the prime minister's also announcing today the fast-tracking of approvals with the commonwealth aiming to halve approval time down to 21 months. what is being sacrificed in shortening that timeframe? alan tudge:\n\u00a0\nin essence, bureaucracy is being sacrificed, not standards. we are doing three things to try to reduce the approvals process. one, we want to put more resources into the assessment; two, we want to reduce some of the duplication between state and federal governments; and three, we want to do some of the processes in parallel, rather than sequentially. you do those three things together, and we think we can get that processing done in half the time than what is presently done. sabra lane: if you're shortening that time, are you cutting corners?\u00a0 alan tudge: no, absolutely not, this is not about cutting corners, it's about cutting bureaucracy. now, we know some of these mega projects, and this is what we are talking about here, 15 mega projects, will deliver 66,000 jobs. we want to get those going as quickly as possible. so that means reducing the bureaucracy rather than cutting corners. sabra lane: this is going to be done through joint assessment teams. alan tudge:\u00a0 that's right. sabra lane: what expertise is there going to be on those teams for looking at environmental issues as well? alan tudge: yeah, it's a good point. the environmental approvals are often one of the lengthier parts of the process here but sometimes you do have complete duplication between state and federal processes. we should be able to minimise the time that is taken to do those environmental approvals without actually reducing the standards. and that's the objective of both the state and the federal governments. in essence, have a one-stop shop rather than both trying to do the same thing at the same time. sabra lane: the government is also, right now, reviewing the environmental protection and biodiversity act. i think that review is due at the end of this month. many conservationists will be concerned that you're just trying to skate over those environmental considerations. how important will be protecting the environment and biodiversity in this fast-tracking process?\n\u00a0\nalan tudge: oh, that is always critical. so i just want to emphasise this is not about cutting corners. this is about reducing the time taken to do the assessments, particularly reducing the duplication between state and federal governments. so we still need to do those environmental assessments, absolutely. we still need to make sure that biodiversity is protected, absolutely. but if we can do it more quickly, which we know that we can, then we can obviously unlock these jobs more rapidly. sabra lane: there'd be some people saying if that can be done now, why didn't you have a crack at this seven years ago when you first were elected? alan tudge: it's a good question and, really, a couple of reasons. one, the need is so important now, the economic need, because of the pandemic; and, two, because we have got such great cooperation with the state governments at the moment as well, so we can work on this concurrently where both levels of government, in fact, all three levels of government recognise that we have to produce jobs at the moment because treasury is forecasting, even in the june quarter, that unemployment will be up towards eight per cent, which is just absolutely catastrophic for so many people. sabra lane: okay, they're mega projects, 15 of them? alan tudge:\u00a0 that's right. sabra lane: typically, they take a long time to get off the ground. alan tudge:\u00a0 they will. sabra lane: how can that happen, then, if you want the economic stimulus to happen right now? alan tudge: typically, they will take three or four years, and so our ambition is to halve that processing time. now, we have actually already done this in part through the snowy hydro 2.0 scheme. so it can be done and we've got absolute commitment from the state governments as well to work cooperatively with us. so the opportunity is there and when you look through how much duplication there is, how much sequential processing there is, rather than parallel processing, i know that it can be done. if we do that, it does mean unlocking 66,000 jobs and we desperately need those jobs right now. sabra lane: more immediately, the government is also announcing today $1.5 billion to small priority projects that are \"shovel ready\". a third will go to road safety works. what other projects are going to be funded here? alan tudge: so the other billion dollars will go to state governments, largely for smaller-scale projects across the country. now, we have been working with them over the last two or three months as they put up their projects. we want the projects to start this year. so it will unlock jobs right across the country, and that's been the key criteria. a billion dollars and, of course, that's on top of that $7.8 billion which we've announced or brought forward since last november. all of this is geared towards trying to get the economy going more rapidly;

and then, second, and perhaps more substantially actually, is a commitment from national and state leaders to fast-track 15 mega projects, where we want to fast-track the assessment process because it will unleash 66,000 jobs, nationally. and, of course, one of those mega projects is the olympic dam's expansion. that's one of the ones which we do want to fast-track to unleash those jobs which will come out of that. david bevan: okay.\u00a0 is that the only mega project in south australia?\u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 well, we have only announced so far just half a dozen of the mega projects, one of which is the olympic dam. we haven't announced the other ones just yet. david bevan: so are there others in south australia?\u00a0 alan tudge: that will all be announced in due course, david.\u00a0 i had a feeling you might ask me that question but they will be announced in due course. david bevan: right.\u00a0 well, if there aren't, you can just rule it out and we won't be in anticipation, minister, of all these generosities. alan tudge: certainly, the olympic dam one and that's a massive project, as you know. it is about a $3 billion expansion and that is going to mean thousands of jobs. the problem with some of these mega projects is that sometimes they take three or four years to get properly assessed and approved and we want to halve that time and that means if you halve the time, obviously the jobs come on more quickly and that's exactly what we're trying to do. david bevan: okay. so how much money are you giving to the olympic dam project?\u00a0 alan tudge: it's $3 billion of investment. nearly all of that, of course, is private investment and for all of the 15 national projects \u2013 it is a combination of private investment plus public investment. the key thing on our behalf, and working with the state government, is to expedite the assessment project. so we're not waiting years and years before the jobs come. david bevan: okay, so how much are you giving bhp to expedite its plans up at roxby?\u00a0 alan tudge: well, it's not giving them money, as such. it's us working jointly with the state government to expedite the approvals process. so that's the key thing.\u00a0 rather than money handing over to bhp, it's us actually putting more money into the assessment process; less duplications and more in assessments. david bevan: well, let me rephrase the question, then. how much money are you putting towards the olympic dam project?\u00a0 alan tudge: i don't know the answer to that, david. if any to be honest, that's not directly within my portfolio responsibilities. but my understanding is that it's largely bhp that's investing in that money, the $3 billion expansion. david bevan: look, i'm sorry, i thought you said the government's announcing today $1.5 billion in new money for mega projects. alan tudge: no, two points. there is $1.5 billion of new money for smaller-scale projects to get going immediately; i.e., this year. david bevan: right. alan tudge: separate to that, we have committed to fast-track the assessment and approvals process of 15 mega projects, one of which is the olympic dam. david bevan: okay, so you might not give them any money?\u00a0 alan tudge: that's what i'm talking about. i don't think there is any public funding in that project, as such.\u00a0 that's why i was a bit hesitant to answer in relation to that question. david bevan: you're just saying that you're going to help the state government fast-track the approvals process for olympic dam, so whatever they are going to spend up there, they'll spend it sooner. alan tudge: more quickly, exactly. david bevan: okay. alan tudge: because the key challenge, as you know and your listeners know, the key challenge at the moment is jobs. treasury forecast that we're going to have north of eight per cent unemployment just in the june quarter and it could be higher. now, that is catastrophic levels of unemployment which we are absolutely not used to. so, jobs are our focus. david bevan: so should people be confident that the approvals process, which presumably is there for a good reason that if it's going to be fast-tracked, that we're not going to get up something at roxby downs that\u2019s well, is bad for the environment. alan tudge: yeah, i know that's one of peoples\u2019 concerns and the answer is that the standards aren't being reduced but the bureaucracy will be. environmental approvals are actually one of the things that do take the most amount of time.\u00a0 and at the moment, though, we have federal environmental approvals as well as state environmental approvals. and our objective here is if we reduce that duplication so it can be done more quickly without reducing the environmental protections, without reducing the public consultation which has to occur. david bevan: well, given the disaster that happened up in the kimberley where those sacred aboriginal sites, which are 46,000 years old, were blown up recently, some people might be a little concerned that you're streamlining approval processes for big miners.\u00a0 alan tudge: yeah, listen, i can appreciate those concerns and my reassurance is that the aim is to reduce the bureaucracy and the time taken rather than to reduce the standards. the standards still need to be high but if you can assess against those standards more quickly and have less duplication between state and federal governments because, you know, perhaps you have a one-stop shop approval process then, of course, you bring the jobs on more rapidly and that's what we're trying to do. david bevan: okay. alan tudge: now, the kimberley situation - sorry, the pilbara situation was a very different one altogether because it actually was a lawful unfortunately, a lawful explosion. but, anyway, it's all sorts of complications in relation to that one. david bevan: well, it was just a disaster, wasn't it?\u00a0 alan tudge: certainly, i think that all concerned are thinking \"how did this happen?\" but it actually, from what i understand it, was a lawful process. but i think the state government and the mining company concerned are going through it, looking at those processes so that type of thing cannot happen again. david bevan: all right. one report i read is that when people woke up to what was actually going on, the mining company turned around and said \"i'm sorry, we've riddled the place with explosives, it's just too dangerous to go in there and pull them out and press the plunger\u201d. alan tudge: yeah, that's my understanding. i don't know the ins and outs of what happened. i do know there has been approval from the aboriginal traditional owners, but some time ago and anyway, the outcome is the outcome, unfortunately. david bevan: all right. well, let's get back to money. alan tudge: yeah. david bevan: because you're talking about $1.5 billion in new money for small-scale projects. what are we going to get out of that?\u00a0 alan tudge: the smaller-scale projects, shovel-ready projects and there are two components to this. one will be road safety projects, typically they're in regional areas where $500 million is allocated for that; and the other billion is for smaller-scale, shovel-ready projects, often they're in the urban areas in adelaide. south australia will get its proportionate share of that $1.5 billion which south australia, five to ten per cent of the population, so it\u2019s a proportionate share. david bevan: so we should get about eight per cent?\u00a0 alan tudge: yeah, that's right. david bevan: eight percent of 1.5 billion and if stephan knoll has got his skates on. alan tudge: well, we have been working closely with stephan knoll and premier marshall to develop these projects.\u00a0 they had given us the list of projects which are shovel-ready and can be done immediately. david bevan: can you name any?\u00a0 alan tudge: i can't, but we'll be announcing those very shortly. in essence, that was the criteria. we said to them \"we want to get money out the door to create jobs. tell us which projects you can start this calendar year\" because if they are not starting this calendar year, we are not interested.\u00a0 they have to be shovel-ready. they have to be able to begin soon so that we can get the jobs going. david bevan: all right. minister, before you leave us, lance from port augusta wants to take you back to olympic dam.\u00a0 good morning, lance. caller lance: good morning, david.\u00a0 good morning, minister.\u00a0 can you tell me, minister, where are you going to get the water from for the expansion for olympic dam? is that the artesian basin or where are you going to get it from?\u00a0 alan tudge: lance, that is a good question and i don't have the answer to that. caller lance: why not?\u00a0 alan tudge: i'm not the minister responsible for that particular project so i'm not across the ins and outs.\u00a0 i just have some overarching responsibility for the funding associated with the large-scale projects and obviously the approvals process, which we are talking about today. david bevan: okay.\u00a0 well, lance, thank you for your call. minister, thank you for your time.\u00a0 alan tudge: absolute pleasure, thanks david. "], "transcript-interview-peter-stefanovic": ["15 June 2020", "peter stefanovic:\u00a0 joining me now, minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure, alan tudge. \u00a0this is ahead of the prime minister's announcement later on today about all these new infrastructure projects around the country. \u00a0minister, good morning to you. \u00a0thanks so much for joining us. \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 good morning, peter.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 so, when can work begin? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 well, there are two things we are announcing, peter. \u00a0one is $1.5 billion of new money to get smaller-scale projects going immediately. \u00a0what i mean by that is this calendar year. \u00a0then the second thing that we are announcing is that we want to accelerate the approval processes of 15 mega projects to unlock 66,000 jobs. \u00a0so, in the meantime, get those projects going immediately, right across australia with that $1.5 billion of stimulus.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 this announcement is going to cause some alarm for environmental groups, no doubt, minister. \u00a0so, are there any environmental corners being cut? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 we are cutting bureaucracy, not environmental corners, peter. \u00a0what we want to do is streamline the processes because sometimes these mega projects can take up to four years for them to get underway. \u00a0therefore, we want to halve that time, and if you do that, it means the jobs come on board more quickly. \u00a0now, how are we going to do this? \u00a0in three ways, firstly, by putting more money into the assessment processes itself. \u00a0second, to reduce some of the duplication between state and federal governments; and, thirdly, by doing some of the processes in parallel, rather than sequentially. \u00a0you do all that together; you can accelerate those projects and get those jobs on more quickly.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 are you expecting resistance from green groups, though? \u00a0i mean we've seen what can happen with major projects. \u00a0i mean adani, for one example, we've got these delays upon delays when, you know, various groups are getting involved. \u00a0so, are they involved in consultation processes alongside federal and state authorities? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 yes, the consultation processes will continue. \u00a0those requirements won't diminish; nor will the environmental standards. \u00a0what we want to do is, is break the bureaucracy, rather than reduce standards and reduce consultation and we think we can do that. \u00a0when you look at snowy hydro 2.0 we were able to get that process through in two years\u2019 time rather than the normal three or four. \u00a0therefore, it can be done and we want to do that on these 15 other mega projects so that we can get these jobs underway more rapidly.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0so let's just identify a couple here, minister. \u00a0this inland rail from melbourne to brisbane for starters. \u00a0so, just to clarify: that's not passenger services, is it? \u00a0that's freight? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 that is freight. it's a $10 billion project. \u00a0it's a massive project right across inland australia, as you said, from melbourne to brisbane and it will make a very big difference to all of those agriculturalists and other people in those inner areas.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 okay, new south wales dams: how many are we talking? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 i don't know the answer to that question. \u00a0i don't look after the dams policy, but we can go through each one and there's major projects in every state just about, that we want to get going. \u00a0the state governments are on board, they equally share our desire to fast-track these projects because all of us know that the key objective at the moment must be to create jobs, because treasury estimates that even in the june quarter unemployment will be at eight per cent or higher. \u00a0now, that is catastrophic levels of unemployment.\u00a0 we have had a five in the unemployment number for so long. \u00a0so we have to focus on jobs and that means we have to reduce some of the bureaucracy so we can get projects going more quickly.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 sure. \u00a0okay, when it comes to these new projects, though, how much of it is new and how much of it an upgrade on existing infrastructure? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 yeah, so two different things here. \u00a0the 15 mega projects which represent about $72 billion worth of investment, both of government investment and private investment, they are existing commitments already and those are about accelerating approvals. \u00a0then we are announcing $1.5 billion of new money. \u00a0now, they will be for two things: one being for road safety upgrades around australia, and two, being for smaller-scale projects across are australia as well, which can get underway this calendar year.\u00a0\nnow, that 1.5 billion, peter, is on top of the already $7.8 billion which we've announced since november of last year of new money or bring forwards, all designed to create jobs which is our central objective, right now.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 okay, minister, a couple of quick ones before you go. \u00a0how concerned are you about the australian man, karm gilespie who is on death row in china?\u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 well, i am personally concerned, and the prime minister and the government are concerned about him. \u00a0we do not support the death penalty anywhere in the world, and we will be making representations or continue to make representations to the communist party governments in china and, of course, he is getting all the consulate assistance available as well, as we speak. \u00a0so, you know, we are thinking about him. \u00a0we are making those representations. \u00a0we do not want to see anybody in the world suffer the death penalty.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 is it politically motivated? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 there is no evidence to suggest that it is. \u00a0i mean, the chinese government has used the death penalty on different nationals from across the world for a long time, and we do not support it. \u00a0we advocate against it. \u00a0and we'll certainly be making and continue to make, very strong representations to ensure that he doesn't face it.\u00a0 peter stefanovic: \u00a0\u00a0 it has got to be another warning, though, doesn't it, minister, for anyone who may be looking to carry drugs or traffic drugs through different countries? \u00a0if you get caught, you're in a whole lot of strife.\u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 oh, that is absolutely the case. \u00a0of course, you should not be doing that but no one deserves the death penalty. \u00a0and we will be making representations to ensure that mr gilespie does not face that, just as we make representations for any single other australian who faces that prospect anywhere in the world.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0just on to this victorian labor mp, adem somyurek accused of branch stacking on 60 minutes last night, a special investigation by them. \u00a0minister, would you support an inquiry into that? \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 oh, i think it needs more than an inquiry. \u00a0i think adem somyurek should be dismissed immediately but, more importantly, this reveals the rotten core of the labor party once again and, of course, it's on top of the cash in aldi bags, on top of the red shirts, on top of sam dastyari selling out australia's interest to the highest bidder. \u00a0it's the rotten core of the labor party revealed once more, and that is the culture that needs to be eradicated. \u00a0so if the inquiry can assist with that, good. \u00a0but i suggest it's going to take more than that.\u00a0 peter stefanovic:\u00a0 all right. \u00a0adem somyurek, meanwhile, has denied any involvement in that, but more to come on that. \u00a0the victorian premier, daniel andrews will be giving a press conference later on and we will bring that to you live. \u00a0minister, appreciate your time this morning. \u00a0thanks for joining us. \u00a0 alan tudge:\u00a0 thanks very much, peter.\n\u00a0 "], "transcript-6pr-interview-gary-adshead": ["15 June 2020", "gary adshead:  not long ago, the prime minister outlined plans for getting jobs back out there, getting the economy up and running, and it's all around infrastructure projects. they want to bring them forward. they want to fast-track them. they had got a hit list of infrastructure projects they'd like to see happening across the country in order to try and generate over 60,000 jobs because that is going to be the crucial issue moving forward. now, as they have outlined, it\u2019s about bringing down some of the barriers on environmental approvals and so on.\u00a0 it's a delicate balancing act but let's have a chat now to alan tudge.\u00a0 he's the federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure. thanks very much for joining us, minister. alan tudge: no worries, gary.\u00a0 thanks for having me. gary adshead: just first up, this money that we're looking at to get infrastructure moving, is this money already in the pipeline or new money? alan tudge: well, it's two things we're announcing today. the first is $1.5 billion of new money and that is for smaller-scale projects which are shovel-ready and can get started immediately; i.e., this calendar year. then, secondly, we have announced 15 mega projects where we want to accelerate the approval processes to unlock 66,000 jobs. typically, these approval processes take three to four years. we want to halve that so that jobs can come on more rapidly. gary adshead: it sounds ambitious because obviously there's legislation in place, there's sort of checks and balances in place for a reason.\u00a0 so how do we get around that? alan tudge: yeah, there are three ways that will actually accelerate this process. first, we are going to put more money into the assessment process. we've got more resources at the table. the second, we want to reduce some of the duplication between state and federal governments; for example, for an environmental approval, sometimes we are doing the same things at two levels of government. and then, thirdly, we want to do some of the processes in parallel, if you like, rather than sequentially because that can save time as well. now, we've already done some of these things with snowy hydro 2.0 over here in new south wales and we got that approval process down to about two years. so we reckon we can do it with some of these other massive projects as well. gary adshead: you talk about these 15 mega projects: obviously, the question on everyone here in western australia's lips is: what are you looking at for us? alan tudge: yeah, we haven't announced that yet and that is going to be coming soon. but obviously, you know, western australia, some of your mega projects are the very big mining projects or the huge rail and road projects which support those. these are the types of things we are going to be looking at.\u00a0 and i mean, you've had discussions there in the past about how long some of these projects take to get approved because, you're waiting four years sometimes to get them approved and we should be able to do them in less than two years, and that's certainly our ambition. gary adshead: some of those mining projects, though, certainly here in western australia, when you talk about the resource sector, you know, they get challenged as well. people bring on challenges to the courts. i mean, that's not something you can do away with and if someone lodges something in the court, that's it, isn't it? alan tudge: no. if someone lodges something in the courts, of course that has to play its course. we do think that we can streamline some of the processes and get rid of the bureaucracy, without actually reducing the standards and without reducing the public consultation, or obviously the consultation with traditional owners, and that sort of thing. so it can be done, it has been done, and i gave an example before, and if we do it, it does mean that the 66,000 jobs, which are connected to these mega projects, can be brought forward. right now, as everybody knows, we desperately need those jobs. gary adshead: yeah, the prime minister i know has said this morning that about $100 billion is being lost in activity because of coronavirus. that's extremely serious. alan tudge: that is right, treasury estimates that we will have unemployment at about eight per cent nationally in the june quarter and it could go higher, and there are just catastrophic levels of unemployment. you know, we haven't seen those for years and years, and we have all got to be focused on this task of building jobs back again, so that people can, have the dignity of work and again save money and pay for the things they need to save for and this announcement is part of that today. gary adshead: do you have a view that people, do suggest that once the jobkeeper program is done with, say september, that we haven't quite seen yet the amount of people that may be being laid off at the end of that process as well? alan tudge: well, we are working through that. as you probably know, we've got a review of the jobkeeper scheme at the moment to work out what should the next steps be. as you point out, it is scheduled to come off in september and then we have to work out, what is the next step after that?\u00a0 hopefully, the economy will be stronger by then but we just don't quite know just yet. eight per cent unemployment in the june quarter \u2013 that really worries me. i hope it doesn't go any higher because eight per cent means that, hundreds of thousands of more people who are on unemployment benefits effectively and without work, and that's not good for anybody. gary adshead: i have just got to ask you this because one of the issues we're waiting for here in western australia to be resolved is the submarine full cycle docking, the maintenance work: it's a massive contract. it is up between south australia and us at this stage.\u00a0 you talk about red tape, which is something that we have been waiting for now since last year.\u00a0 that was going to be announced before christmas but here in western australia everything is still on hold as to whether we are the people to get that. so, i mean, you know, you have to look in your own backyard here because that is a decision that is long overdue. alan tudge: yeah, i don't know where that decision is at, i'm not responsible for that. but i can appreciate your desire to have that outcome known as soon as possible.\u00a0 certainly, we are looking at our own backyard in terms of the approvals processes which we have, and the environmental approvals process is probably the biggest single one which we are looking at. we actually have a full review into that at the moment and we're working cooperatively with state governments to see where we can streamline or reduce that duplication without reducing standards. gary adshead: this is all about the economy and the need to kick-start it again. one of the issues here, of course, is that our premier is saying, well he is not saying actually, when he will open the state border.\u00a0 there's no timeline in place for us yet.\u00a0 is that a concern?\u00a0 we know that the federal government is going join an action in the high court to challenge it, constitutionally. do you support that?\u00a0 is it important to have that resolved before you can move on with looking at jobs and the economy? alan tudge: we would certainly like to see all the borders reopened again and every other premier and chief minister has now announced when they're going to open their borders, but western australia has not.\u00a0 we would certainly like to see it announced so there is a timeframe we can look towards. now, why do we want the borders open? so you can get the free trade of goods, the free trade of people again, you can get tourism going internally. that's going to be good for western australia as much as it's going to be good for the rest of the country. and, of course, western australia does want international students to come back as well because that's great for the economy. and we've indicated that, well, if you can't take a student from sydney, how can you take a student from singapore? so it's in western australia's interests, we think, but obviously it's going to be a decision ultimately for the premier there. gary adshead: do you think our premier is playing politics in terms of the support level he's got because there's a lot of people over here that support this hard border at the moment, or is he doing it for health reasons? alan tudge: listen, i don't know. you'll have to ask him. gary adshead: i've tried. alan tudge: look, i think all the states and territories have managed the covid crisis very well in consultation with the prime minister; he formed the national cabinet, as you know. so i don't want to be a critic of either premier mcgowan or any other premier. gary adshead: but it's time? dragging our feet now? alan tudge: we do want to see the borders open, absolutely. there's no health advice which says that they should be closed: that's the thing. we've made this point repeatedly that the national medical expert committee, which has been guiding the decisions that we have been making at every step of the way, has not ever said the borders should be closed. gary adshead:\u00a0 minister, thanks very much for joining us this morning, appreciate it. alan tudge: many thanks, gary.

federal member for lindsay, who has three stations in their electorate, i'm really excited about the jobs that are coming to western sydney with the new rail link. and importantly, at orchard hills, we'll have a new town centre which will create new jobs for small businesses in our community and a revitalisation of st marys. and at luddenham, we'll have a new innovation and health and education precinct. and as we emerge from this coronavirus pandemic, it\u2019ll be a real investment into jobs for local people who are currently, there\u2019s 300,000 locals commuting out of our area every day, i did that commute for over 10 years. so i'm really excited to have the prime minister here today, the premier of new south wales and state and federal colleagues, to announce this very exciting phase in the transformation of western sydney. prime minister. prime minister: well, thank you, melissa and to stuart ayres as well, of course, as our local mps out here in western sydney, and to premier berejiklian, who's been such a tremendous partner in the work of the national cabinet.\u00a0 and it's great to be here in the open state of new south wales gladys, i'm sure you'd agree and ministers would agree. and as we go about this task of reopening our economy, but no more so here than in new south wales, the effort to ensure we got on top of covid-19. new south wales faced the biggest challenges in dealing with covid-19. their response has been tremendous, and they've been a great partner to work with through these many, many months. and i want to thank you, gladys, for your leadership, not just, as we manage the pandemic, but your leadership in opening new south wales up and getting our economy moving again. it's incredibly, incredibly important. and today is another key step in this process.\u00a0 when i talk about the federation working together, we\u2019re governments working together, this is what we're talking about, $14 billion dollars the commonwealth government is investing here in western sydney, $5.3 billion dollars to build this airport. we\u2019re spending some $3.3 billion dollars together with the state government, coming on top of that to see the many roads here that have been developed in and around this airport. and then there is the additional investment that we're putting in, and that's an investment into the rail projects. and today we're announcing from the commonwealth perspective, we're putting in another $1.75 billion dollars into this programme, which will take our total investment in the rail projects to $5.25 billion dollars.\u00a0 these are job making investments. when i talk about a jobmaker program, it's about projects like this. it's about the partnerships we're bringing together not just with the new south wales state government here in western sydney, but right across the country bringing forward programmes of investment. last year we worked to bring forward $4.2 billion dollars in infrastructure works. just a week and a half ago, we announced another $1.2 billion dollars in bring forward works for local government. and here we're putting in another $1.75 billion dollars. this means we are getting more projects happening now because that's the job making agenda that australia needs, that new south wales needs and that western sydney needs. and we couldn't hope for a better partner in our job making programme than the new south wales government, they get projects, they get projects done. and they get the job, some 14,000 jobs are part of this rail initiative that will connect sydney's second airport, the western sydney nancy bird walton airport, which we've been out here on many occasions as different stages of the projects have proceeded and you can see the earth moving equipment in the back. you can see that it's all happening.\u00a0 this is how australia makes its way back out of the covid-19 crisis. infrastructure projects like this one making sure they keep up to the mark. this project, i'm advised and we understand and it's a key part of today's announcement is we'll be able to commence this year, which is great news for jobs. the other important part of this partnership is that we share the load on this investment. the ultimate cost of this project of the rail project is 50/50 between the commonwealth and the state government here in new south wales. but the shares in the early phase of the project will be principally carried by the federal government and later in the project then it will be picked up by the state. so overall, you've got a 50/50 partnership, but we want to make sure this is happening now. and that's why the commonwealth has made the decision we have to put in the extra investment and make sure we're pushing that investment and in the early phases, that project.\u00a0 so with that, it's great to have my national cabinet partner here in gladys berejiklian. and and we thank you very much for the for the partnership on this very important project. thank you, gladys.\u00a0 the hon. gladys berejiklian mp, premier of new south wales: wonderful, thank you pm. firstly, can i thank the prime minister for his national leadership of what has been a very difficult time for our state and our nation. and today is a wonderful example of cooperation between the federal and state government in relation to our jobs strategy. yesterday, i was pleased to join with my state colleagues in announcing our $100 billion dollar infrastructure pipeline and what the support of the prime minister and the federal colleagues means is that here in western sydney to support the airport we will be able to build a metro as soon as we can and make sure that it's open when passengers start flying in and out of this wonderful airport.\u00a0 again, a wonderful example of how the way through this economic disaster is not an underestimate in terms of what our economy is going through, it is through jobs creation, and this project alone the new metro linking st marys station to the airport will create 14,000 jobs here in new south wales. and that's music to our ears because we know in april we lost 221,000 jobs in new south wales. and we also know that there's so many other of our fellow citizens on jobkeeper. and we know we have a job ahead of us in getting people back to work, getting people in sustainable jobs and having those direct and indirect jobs created by this project is fantastic, especially given through the partnership with the federal government, through the support of the prime minister and his colleagues, that we're able to start construction this year, which means an acceleration of those jobs that are being created.\u00a0 and of course, from a passenger perspective, new south wales has demonstrated our ability to build metros. we have built, obviously the north-west metro has been a huge success. the second harbour rail crossing will be open by 2023, going to sydenham and then out to bankstown, and i want to also thank the federal and state ministers that are here from new south wales, ministers\u2019 constance and ayre's who have both been strong advocates for both this airport and the precinct, but also for for public transport. and as we know, the new south wales government, in supporting the federal government's efforts in building the airport, is also creating an aerotroplis, an airport city. so we know that this rail line won't only service the airport, but service so many people that will call this place home or will come to this place for work. and that is a wonderful thing to look forward to in new south wales.\u00a0 of course, we continue to say in new south wales, our priority remains health and jobs. and again, our ability to accelerate our infrastructure pipeline is music to our ears. again, i want to thank the prime minister and his colleagues for their support on this project. it's not often that federal governments step up and provide half the funding for a public transport project. a lot of people talk about it, but very few people actually put money down on the table. and that's why i'm so grateful to the prime minister. i can't remember such a huge contribution from a federal government in public transport in new south wales, especially in metro. this is the first joint project we're building as far as metro is concerned. it's a wonderful milestone, not just for jobs, but also in the way in which we can work together for the future. i'm deeply grateful and rest assured that we will maintain our end of the bargain, which is to get the construction started, to get those jobs coming, and to make sure the project is built on time. and again, i want to thank all of our federal and state colleagues for pushing so hard. i know the prime minister and i have been on our toes listening to the colleagues and making sure that we deliver this as soon as we can.\u00a0 the hon. alan tudge mp, minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure: prime minister and premier and colleagues, the federal government has investments in massive projects right across the country, be it in the m1 in brisbane, the airport rail in melbourne, the north south corridor in adelaide, or metronet in perth. but nothing compares to the scale, the ambition and the transformation as to what we collectively are doing here in western sydney. we've got $5.3 billion dollars invested in this site alone to build what will be the size of adelaide airport when it opens in 2026. we've got the new 23 kilometres worth of rail, which we are announcing today. and of course we've got another $3.5 billion dollars worth of road investments around this area as well.\u00a0 and what does all that mean? it means jobs, jobs and more jobs. collectively, that's now 29,000 jobs, which we have announced right now for the next few years until 2026. and 14,000 of that 29 will be from this new rail line connecting st marys to this airport site and onto the aerotropolis. so this is an incredible job making programme. and of course, by 2026, when this airport is operational, we estimate there'll be a further 28,000 direct and indirect jobs in and around the airport as a result of this airport being open. brand new international airport connected by rail, connected by freeways connected into the university sector, indigenous participation, local jobs. so this project of the rail line with the airport and the other roads is not just about jobs for today, but absolutely transforming western sydney for the future so that people can live here, they can study here, they can work here, and they can play here without necessarily having to always go into the cbd or elsewhere in sydney.\u00a0 it's great to be here in partnership with the new south wales government. i particularly thank andrew constance, stuart ayres for the cooperation which they've afforded myself and other federal ministers, as well as we have worked through this process. this is gonna be a magnificent project when it's all completed. it means that you'll be able to, if you land here in western sydney airport, jump on the train and get to st marys in 15 minutes or to the cbd in an hour. and of course, it'll be the major transport spine for western sydney going forward.\u00a0 so it's great to be here alongside the prime minister and the premier. but particularly i'd like to thank stuart ayres and andrew constance for their cooperation in making this project a reality.\u00a0 the hon. andrew constance mp, minister for transport and roads: look, first of all, can i just particularly thank the prime minister and the premier, you know, to have this strength of leadership behind a public transport project is unprecedented and there's no doubt if you look at this as a holistic project in terms of the park land city, it's not every day you get to see a rail line and an airport being built concurrently and that delivering the opportunities for so many. one of the most powerful times that the premier and i've had with the sydney metro project on the north west was to meet young people who were working on the job for the first time and being part of the metro project where we've already generated 30,000 jobs and now another 14,000 at a time when everybody is uncertain about what the future holds, yet strong leadership from our national and state government means that people can have some confidence and isn't it nice to be able to build something where we're not retrofitting part of the city? this is, this is truly greenfield. it gives every opportunity for new investment, for the jobs that alan just spoke of. so to that end, this is a great day in terms of kicking along. just some specifics in relation to the project. construction will start this year. we'll get on with geotech preliminary construction work and then we'll move into major construction next year. it's 23 kilometres of rail line, 6 stations. the main interchange point will be at st marys, where it will connect to the t1 western line. the great thing about it is it will also lead to opportunities at luddenham, at orchard hills in terms of further investment from those who are looking to invest and it goes through to the aerotropolis, which is going to be really something incredibly special for our country if you consider the international interest and the job creation, both in terms of everything from the sciences through to the education and opportunities that are present, particularly people of western sydney.\u00a0 what we do know with western sydney is that it's going to double in population between now and 2056. that means we need this rail line. it won't be a case of people waiting years and years and years till a rail line comes to them. and that's something which, again, will drive the opportunities, both residential and employment. and if you consider that western sydney has about 300,000 people leave it every day to go to a place of employment. this incredible hub is something which can turn that around, turn it around quick and improve the quality of life for everybody.\u00a0 thanks.\u00a0 the hon. stuart ayres mp, minister for investment, tourism and western sydney: this new north south rail line is a steel spine that will anchor the future economic and social prosperity for every single citizen in outer western sydney. for the first time, we're putting in the infrastructure before the houses. making sure that our community can be connected to the jobs that they need close to where they live. this is about creating more jobs closer to people's homes, people's areas of recreation and making sure they've got the opportunities to have the knowledge jobs close to their homes. this has been an amazing team australia opportunity. there's not another place anywhere in the world that has $20 billion dollars worth of infrastructure being invested in it across both the federal government and a provincial or state government, an airport, a rail line, a new aerotropolis. it's the focal point for investment from overseas, and it's the focal point for investment here in western sydney by locals as well. we set out with the task of creating 200,000 jobs for people in western sydney to recalibrate our city, to reshape the outer west of sydney so people didn't have to travel from west to east to work. we're achieving that today. we're putting those markers in the ground so people can say to their families, there'll be job opportunities, international connectivity and world class transport infrastructure right here in their backyard. this is a 10 year vision coming to fruition.\u00a0 i want to thank everyone that's been involved in it, the commonwealth government, the state government, the team that reports to me through the aerotropolis authority, all of the work that's been done around making this an attractive location for international investors. these are markers in the ground that will simply reshape our future. this is the first time we're building a rail line, that john bradfield didn't put on a map in sydney nearly 100 years ago. this is us taking our future into our own hands and making sure that western sydney is not only driving the future social and economic prosperity of their own region, but also new south wales and the nation.\u00a0 journalist: i\u2019m wondering how practical a timeline of 2026 is, especially considering there's a lot of, you know, holes have been exposed in our supply chains during this covid crisis? premier berejiklian: sure, look there's no doubt that's definitely a challenge for us, but we are hoping that there won't be too much of a gap between when the airport opens and the rail-line opens and we've given a cost of around $11 billion dollars in out-turn dollars. but obviously, when you start doing the geotech work, as minister constance said, you can come across some other design issues. so we appreciate the challenges that are before us. our intention is to have it completed in 2026/2027 financial year. but obviously we'll keep the community updated if there's any change in that, because you're absolutely right, the supply chains have been just disrupted around the world, including within our own nation. but we are confident, obviously, with construction starting this year, that the jobs will start. we know the initial phase doesn't rely on those things we\u2019d normally rely on so were able to kick start the initial phase. and we're hoping that construction will still be around 26-27. journalist: if it costs more than you expect, this $11 billion dollars, who\u2019s on the hook then for the extra costs, new south wales or the feds? premier berejiklian: i anticipate that we\u2019ll share, we\u2019ll talk about that, i anticipate we will share that. journalist: does australia have enough skilled workers to be building two metro lines concurrently? premier berejiklian: absolutely. absolutely, what we've demonstrated already with the northwest metro, the second harbour rail crossing is that we have partners here in australia and also global partners who are based here in new south wales. so the skills we have are here, the people we have are here and please remember, we have hundreds of thousands of people across the state currently who don't have jobs. and it's an opportunity for us where appropriate, to reskill. for example, when minister constance mentioned what joy it was for us to see people on the north west rail line getting jobs for the first time, we met middle aged people who had done electrical engineering courses or had done courses at tafe who were working on construction sites or in major projects for the first time. so let's also not underestimate the capacity for this project to be a big jobs driver. and we also know that across western sydney, as minister ayres would know, we have also put a specific focus through our tafe system, whether it's through mount druitt or other tafes, where we have specialised construction courses, where the private sector has really driven to make sure that we have enough skills for people to drive the equipment. and we know, unfortunately, that one of the big areas where people have lost jobs, the demographic is young people, is youth. and if we can reskill or support some of those young people to get apprenticeships and to consider construction, that's a huge win for new south wales.\u00a0 journalist: [inaudible] premier berejiklian: i'm sorry, i didn't hear the question? there\u2019s people working, yeah. journalist: realistically, how many jobs by the end of the year do you think you can have for australians out of work at the moment? just on this project by the end of this year? premier berejiklian: generally? or just on this project? journalist: just on this project. premier berejiklian: yeah, well, obviously, that will, we'll try and gear up as quickly as we can. and the 14,000 jobs is over, obviously over the life of the project. but what happens is when our private sector partners have confidence the government is delivering something, they also hire people as well. people also think about what qualifications they want to achieve. so, for example, when we issued 100,000, well 100,000 people took up free tafe courses, a lot of those were in medical administration and jobs where they knew there was a higher demand. so when governments get together and announce projects like this, it encourages young people to consider those career options. so obviously our intent is to get as many people into jobs as quickly as possible, which is why across new south wales, we're looking at the larger projects, the medium sized ones, but also the very smaller ones at community level. and we'll try and get those online as soon as we can.\u00a0 journalist: will there be some kind of quota or target to ensure that the jobs are going to western sydney locals? premier berejiklian: well, it goes, it's a matter of course, that if you live within a region, you're more likely to put your hand up and want to work in the region. but we also know from experience that a lot of the tertiary institutions, whether they're universities or tafes in western sydney, have geared up for this pipeline. and that's why the government's also invested in specialised skills training in those tafes to really gear up and encourage younger people to consider these options, whether it's in engineering, whether it's in construction work, whether it's driving some of these very complex vehicles as well, which will be needed for the metro. and, of course, it'll be encouraging once the major construction starts. but to be able to say construction starts this year is just a huge win. journalist: is part of the asterisk on the price because you haven\u2019t decided whether it\u2019s going to be underground tunnelling for the aerotropolis and why hasn\u2019t that decision been made? premier berejiklian: yeah, a couple of reasons. firstly, we always say \u2018around\u2019 until we've done the geotech work which minister constance alluded to. so with our experience with the north-west metro, and the second harbour rail crossing. you don't know the final final cost until you've gone through that process of issuing all the contracts. so we know it'll be around that time. and i and i will say the new south wales government is considering our options around the aerotropolis as to whether we go under or not. and so that could have an impact as well. but at this stage. that's what the parameters of the project are. journalist: what would be your preference? to go under? premier berejiklian: well, look i don\u2019t want to- journalist:\u00a0because obviously a world class city with a rail line cutting through... premier berejiklian: look, i don't want to speculate. we're looking at all the options. our focus is jobs. our focus is getting the metro up and running as soon as possible. and we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\u00a0 journalist: can you provide insight into where exactly the stations will be and if any homes may have to be acquired in the process? premier berejiklian: certainly, would anyone else like to answer that?\u00a0 minister constance: look, first of all, we went through a process with everybody who we need to acquire the property of at a personal level. and that's what we've done with all the big projects. the beauty with this project is there's not that many properties that we actually have to deal with. so over the next couple of weeks, we will go to those that we need to acquire the property off. of course, we have a very clear idea where those properties are and we will obviously engage there appropriately at the right time. but the main thing at the moment, though, is to have those 6 stations, orchard hills and luddenham are being confirmed, of course, the aerotropolis makes sense, two at the airport and one at st marys. it's going to be a rail line that's like no other in that sense. it'll be a single deck metro train, driverless. we've seen the technology and the advancements it has brought the north west, but it won't be anywhere near the property acquisitions that we've seen.\u00a0 journalist: do you have a figure for how many acquisitions there will be? minister constance: not at this stage. but to the premier's point i mean, we've got to make some decisions in relation to tunnelling as well.\u00a0 journalist: premier, can i ask for an update on your plan to fast track the return of international students into new south wales to provide some stimulus for struggling universities at this time and perhaps the prime minister as well on the federal government\u2019s approach? premier berejiklian: yes, certainly we're working on that plan. the plan is not yet finalised, but we're certainly starting the conversation and seeing what that might look like and what is pleasing and i know health would have updated their information, is what is pleasing is whilst restrictions ease, the risk of a virus is great. we have seen a very low to zero community to community transmission, but we have to be aware that the cases we have had in new south wales have come from people in quarantine in our hotels, and we have to be very mindful of that. but obviously, we're working through those issues and speaking to universities. and i particularly worry about our regional universities who will need to lay off jobs if we don't provide them with support and so both the deputy premier and myself are in particular concerned about the future viability of those universities, not necessarily in the next 6 months, but potentially beyond that point. and so we're working through these issues and the prime minister's also been very open minded to our strategy in that regard.\u00a0 journalist: has the fact that most of new south wales recent cases have come from returned travellers in quarantine hotels perhaps put a bit of a pause on that process to fast track international students? premier berejiklian: yeah, well, i think from all the cases that we've we've fortunately not had any community transmission in the last 5 days in new south wales. that's not to suggest that's the benchmark, because it\u2019s not and it won't be, as we ease restrictions today and i've been very open about this we should expect there to be more cases. we should expect there to be what we call outbreaks in certain communities and we will get on top of that. we have to be mindful of that. but there's no doubt that even when you have people in quarantine, we're managing it extremely well. in fact, we're managing it on behalf of our other state colleagues, a number of those people who've acquired the disease or have the disease in quarantine are from other states. and we've been managing it extremely well. but it is a huge logistical exercise and we have to weigh that up. but i'm confident we'll find a pathway through in relation to how we can start helping our universities, especially in the regions, deal with that matter. journalist: premier, gyms and cinemas, are we any closer? premier berejiklian: we are closer. so in relation to, in relation to the former, we'll have something to say about that this week.\u00a0 journalist: given what you announced yesterday with anz stadium and peter v\u2019landys now welcoming that, if we maybe have three or four boutique stadiums built in sydney, given the prime minister is a big supporter of suburban football, and the sharks in particular, what are the chances of that happening?\u00a0 premier berejiklian: look, can i be very upfront and frank, everybody would appreciate that we're in the middle of a pandemic. our first priority is jobs. and we will be looking towards those projects that generate the most jobs and provide employment for the hundreds of thousands of people in new south wales who are without a job. and we worry, of course, as the prime minister does, the pm's always spoken about jobkeeper and how that can't go on forever. and as a state, we're gearing up for that. we know that new south wales has had a disproportionate, disproportionate impact because of our reliance on hospitality and the services sector and education that has impacted new south wales more than others, especially for young people. and that's what we'll be looking for, job opportunities or reskilling and retraining, which allows us to get people back into work and also people of all ages. it's very difficult when you're my age and older to have to think about a career change if you've lost your job, how are you going to get back into getting a job? and so these are issues which are top of mind for us. so we will, of course, engage with all of our stakeholders, listen to all of our stakeholders, but we'll always take decisions that are in the best interests of our citizens.\u00a0 journalist: would it be possible for the prime minister to do like with metro, a 50/50 deal for suburban grounds, particularly for southern sydney? prime minister: well, i think the premier, i think, has set out the priorities pretty well. there are lots of wishlists around, lots of things. but what matters right now is how we invest to create as many jobs as possible. i mean, we have a job making coalition here right across the country. and so whether it's on projects like this one where we're sharing a partnership or indeed the energy partnership we have with the new south wales government, which is trying to get the price of energy down for small businesses so they can create jobs, whether it's the partnership we can have on skills training going forward, whether it's the partnership we have on our health system. i mean, on friday, we were able to conclude the biggest health agreement between the states and the commonwealth ever sealed, $31 billion dollars of extra investment in our hospitals around the country and obviously, the biggest part of that investment is here in new south wales. and i thank the premier, again, for her support of that agreement. what australians are seeing here is governments working together to make jobs. and that's what our job is at the moment. and when, the more jobs you make, that means the economy can support australians at a time when australians are feeling the pinch more than ever before. so, you know, we're always open to having discussions about things. but the measure that the premier and i put across everything and this is true right across all the states and territories, is how many jobs is it going to create. we're in the job making business.\u00a0 journalist: can i ask you about robodebt, don\u2019t you think that australians deserve an apology over that and do you think that potentially it\u2019s overdue given how many lives could have been ruined and how many australians committed suicide over this? prime minister: well, we're putting this right. and let's be clear about what the change is here. the income averaging principle is one that has been followed by labor and coalition governments for a very long period of time. and over the course of dealing with this issue, that that principle was not something that could be relied upon. that doesn't mean those debts don't exist. it just means that they cannot be raised solely on the basis of using income averaging. and i think all australians would agree that it's important that if there are overpayments of welfare or other things like that, then the government has to be diligent about taxpayers funds and make sure that we recover moneys where it's right to do so. but you've got to do it in the lawful way. and we will continue to ensure that we do that with our programmes going forward. this has been a difficult project for many. but what i can say is the government's putting it right. journalist: prime minister, if you\u2019re the family member of someone who has potentially committed suicide because of robodebt, [inaudible] don\u2019t care about the politics of it, don\u2019t you think they deserve an apology? prime minister: well, we're still working through some legal procedures here right now. and so i think the time for those sorts of statements are at another time not right now, we're in the middle of making this right. but i want to stress again that the principle that sits at the heart of this issue is not the technology. what sits at the heart of this issue is the principle of income averaging, and income averaging has been practised by labor and coalition governments for a long period of time. and that's the principle, journalist: someone who\u2019d lost a family member? prime minister: australians are going through all sorts of hardship at present. and that's why our government is reaching out to them in every possible way we can. our government has provided the sort of mental health support which has been critical not just during a pandemic, but over many stresses. and so these are difficult issues to manage. and i think the government has great regrets about any pain or injury that has been caused here. but as i said, those are issues that we're still working through and we're making it right. and i think that's that's the important step.\u00a0 journalist: prime minister, you dropped two bombshells on two friday afternoons in a row, first the jobkeeper bungle, and then the robodebt last friday afternoon, what have you got in store this friday afternoon? prime minister: well we will continue to create jobs every week and that's why we're here. and that's what our government is doing. we're in the job making business and we're going to keep making jobs because australia needs to come out of this covid crisis, strongly. and that's what we're doing where there are issues to address, we deal with them, we fix the problems and we keep going forward. that's how you deal with difficult issues. and that's what, exactly what we've done.\u00a0 journalist: does stuart robert still have your full confidence, prime minister? prime minister: of course. journalist: what\u2019s the process the government used for that income averaging under the scheme, was it illegal in the end? prime minister: it was. as i said, a practice followed by labor and coalition governments for a long period of time.\u00a0 journalist: but it turned out to be illegal? prime minister: this is the advice we have.\u00a0 journalist: can i just ask about foreign students? prime minister: yes you can, about foreign students. journalist: should they get exemptions, how quickly should they be able to come back into the country, and did you think that could have exemptions from the 14 day mandatory quarantine to help boost regional universities in new south wales? prime minister: well, i would say that, i mean, issues of the quarantine will obviously be matters for the state government as they manage the health issues involved with any of those sorts of things. and we'll work closely with the state government as to how they want to move forward on this. right now, our focus federally is ensuring that we open our universities for domestic students. we need to remember that our universities have been built in this country to address the higher education needs of australian students and to build up the skills and capacities and research that australia needs amongst our own people. and that is the primary purpose of universities, now the international business they've engaged in over many years has become important, to them there's no doubt about that. but what we want right now, and that's why we have underwritten the domestic student business of the universities, is to ensure that they can get their doors open for their australian students, and for international students there are many risks to manage there, but i think what has been demonstrated by the states, whether here in new south wales or elsewhere, that they have been able to run, i think, very effective quarantine arrangements for returning australian citizens and residents. and that experience can now be put to work to see how it can support other parts of the economy. and obviously, international students is one of those. but let's let's walk before we run on this. we cannot be complacent about a further wave, i'm sure the premier would agree. and while new south wales in particular is opening up, ensuring social distancing continues to be practised, ensuring that you continue to download the covidsafe app, these are incredibly important protections that keep everybody healthy and keep everybody safe and means that we can continue to take the steps to open up our economy that is so desperately needed. so as we move out and about, and it's great to be out and about, on this beautiful western sydney day, we must be mindful that the coronavirus is still out there, it hasn't gone anywhere. our protections are much stronger and you can keep them stronger by following all the health advice that we have received and is being conveyed to you on a daily basis.\u00a0 journalist: house renovations, prime minister, house renovations, what are we looking at there. do they need to be environmentally friendly, what are we, are we talking about means tested, what\u2019s the...\u00a0 prime minister: well, what you've seen from the government when the coronavirus first hit, is we ensured we laid down the strongest possible safety net and platform to ensure australians could be supported during the economic crisis, jobkeeper, jobseeker, the cash flow allowance, some $150 billion dollars of safety net for australians, broad based. now, as time goes on, there are sectors who will endure more of the pain for longer. and what we've seen, there'll be gaps that occur in our economy, and house building, residential construction will be one of those gaps that we have to address. and so the treasurer and i, working with our colleagues and where states have taken up that invitation to work with us on these issues. and there are many programmes here in new south wales. we'll have more to say about this once the details are finalised. but it is about creating jobs and supporting jobs in our residential construction sector. the tradies and all the others, the apprentices and others who work in that home building sector are a sector we know are going to feel a lot of pain unless we can keep a continuity in the business of house construction whether here in new south wales or anywhere else. journalist: prime minister are you [inaudible] early super [inaudible]? prime minister: well, it's their money, it's their money. i don't go around telling people how to spend their own money.\u00a0 journalist: [inaudible] compliance policy in hindsight [inaudible]? prime minister: no.\u00a0 journalist: [inaudible] prime minister: no. journalist: prime minister, can you confirm that the new south wales government has failed in their handling of the ruby princess? prime minister: no, we\u2019ve worked together on this and we\u2019ll continue to work together. i mean, when you look at the success that new south wales has been able to achieve on dealing with the biggest risks of the coronavirus, now we both agree that, you know, not everything's going to go perfectly to plan on every occasion. but i tell you what, i'd rather be in australia than anywhere else in the country, anywhere else in the world, i should say, when it comes to how this issue has been managed across australia, it has been a great team effort. and it's important that when challenges have come up, that we've worked together on them and and we've kept going forward.\u00a0 but it seems as though the trucks are winning the battle of the noise here and i\u2019ll have to conclude it there. thanks very

increased the government's infrastructure pipeline to a guaranteed 100 billion. so, to tell us more, we're joined by the federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure, alan tudge. good morning, minister. alan tudge: g'day wendy. hi robbie. robbie buck: good morning. okay, well tell us about the fast tracking and, pardon the pun, of the metro to the western sydney airport. alan tudge: well, this is a really exciting project and it's going to connect up the metro from st marys with the new station, orchards hill, and at luddenham and then on to the airport. it's almost an $11 billion project and it's going to create 14,000 jobs over the next six years before it opens at the time for the western sydney airport to be officially opened. robbie buck: okay. tell us about the responsibilities or the bill that's going to go to the federal and to the state; how much is each putting in for this? alan tudge: we are putting in fifty-fifty into this project and we have just upped it about an extra $3.5 billion collectively since our initial estimates a couple of years ago and that, all up, means about $11\u00a0billion. that is on top of the 5.3 billion of federal money that we are putting into the western sydney airport project itself, plus we have about $3.5 billion in other roads around western sydney. so there is just an enormous amount of construction and activity going on there, and that is absolutely great news for western sydney people so that they can live, work and play all out in the western sydney area. wendy harmer: so, 14,000 jobs you say: what kind of jobs will they be? alan tudge: they are going to be all sorts of different types. so obviously all the trades, plus your crane and your forklift operators, your tunnellers, your surveyors, your truck drivers, plus all the other suppliers of the goods, which will be required in this as well. so, this is a monster job-making project. wendy harmer: we had a text from one of our listeners who says all this money seems to be going into male dominated industries and where is a similar injection for those who - for perhaps female dominated sectors who've done just as badly? alan tudge: well, i mean, i think all the companies are doing much better these days at getting women into the construction industry, to be honest, and if you go out on the sites, and i'll be heading out to the western sydney airport site today, you do see a lot of women on site. but, i mean, some of the more traditional female dominated industries such as the health sector, i mean they're particularly feeling it at the moment and we've really boosted the efforts there, as you know. robbie buck: okay. give us an idea of the timeframe for this route. when is it going to open and what kind of figures are you projecting in terms of, you know, how it's going to be used and where people are travelling on it? alan tudge: it's going to start construction this year and it will be finished in 2026 which is when we're forecasting for the western sydney international airport to be officially opened. so the plan was always to get the airport built and to have rail and freeway connections from the day that the airport would be opened. it will connect up this railway line, as i said, from st\u00a0marys and then curve around a new station at orchards hill, a new station at luddenham, and then on to the airport precinct itself, and then it will be past the airport onto what we're calling the western sydney aerotropolis, which is a larger commercial zone as well. so it's about 15\u00a0kilometres all-up, sorry, about 23 kilometres, all-up, of track; about 15 minutes from st\u00a0mary's to the airport. robbie buck: okay, and what about to the centre of the city from the airport, what kind of timeframe? alan tudge: well, i'm not sure what the timeframe is. if you are a commuter who is going into town, i guess that's probably an hour but i don't know the precise time. robbie buck: all right. wendy harmer: okay. well, one of our listeners in leichhardt, minister, he wants to put you through your hoops this morning. he says that this new injection of 3.5 billion into the sydney airport rail link is being characterised as a cash injection, when in fact it's probably, if you look at the original build date, scope and figures, it's more like a cost blow-out. what do you say to that? alan tudge: well, two things to that. i mean, being that since the initial design we've actually added about 5.8 kilometres worth of tunnelling. so, most of the additional cost is for tunnelling and things like putting the st marys station underground, and that obviously all adds cost, but what it does is add considerable amenity to residents out that way. and the second point though is that since two years ago, we've updated the details of cost analysis. you have the full business case, which obviously fine tunes those figures and gets yourself into the position to go out to market and get construction underway. robbie buck: okay. at, i guess, a slightly broader level to do with the airport, whenever we discuss that on the radio, there are lots of concerns from people who live in western sydney. they're all appreciative of the jobs and the economic benefits, but they are really concerned about the nature of an airport operating 24 hours a day in their part of the world, and i guess a lot of people in the blue mountains are feeling that concern as well. what is your message to people in the area about having planes coming in and out 24 hours a day? alan tudge: listen, i can understand some of their concerns and i'll be particularly interested in the flight paths and we have still got many years to go before we'll be finalising those, because obviously the airport won't be open until 2026. what we do know, though, is largely and where possible they will be taking off and landing from the south-west, which is where the least densely populated areas. and the other thing i i'd say on this too, is that the airport was designed really well, in part because the land was set aside, as you know, 50 years ago, and it means that about 10 kilometres at either end of the runway will be almost completely resident-free, if you like; whereas, you know, at kingsford smith, you've got houses within, you know, i think it's 500 metres or a kilometre. robbie buck: okay. wendy harmer: and can you remind us, minister, just of some of the other \"shovel-ready\" projects that you're looking at for new south wales? alan tudge: well, this is the single biggest one, which we are announcing today but then we have projects right across australia in terms of shovel ready projects, and we are going to be announcing some more in the not-too-distant future as well. you might recall over just a couple of weeks ago we announced a further $500 million to go towards the local councils so that they can do those really localised projects in every suburb across the state but there'll be more to come. robbie buck: okay. well, it looks like there's going to be a lot of shovels ready to go, if that is the case. alan tudge: well, that's what we hope. robbie buck: that's the term we're hearing, absolutely. minister, we will leave it there but thank you very much for your time this morning. alan tudge: yes, thanks very much robbie and thank you wendy. wendy harmer: thank you. robbie buck: alan tudge who is the federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure.

alan tudge: i will leave it to them in terms of where they access their money. we've certainly got concerns in terms of them signing up to the belt and road initiative. that is something that we didn't support at the federal level. they have to answer that question as to why they did, why they're the only state that do it. from the federal perspective, when we access the markets for debt, which we obviously have to do now, because we're back into deficit, we go onto the broader international markets. now that will come from all over the place but some of it will probably come from china as well. neil mitchell: some of the federal money? alan tudge: some of the federal money but you go to the international markets, we don't go to china and ask specifically for money from china, we go to the international bond market. the recent bond offering, by the way, which the federal government put out, was mainly subscribed by australian banks who provided the money as opposed to even internationally. neil mitchell: okay. now, the small projects fund, how much will the average council get? alan tudge: so the average council gets almost about $3 million extra between that $500 million of new money, plus the bring forwards of another $1.3 million from out years into this upcoming financial year. neil mitchell: sorry, i don't understand. they are going to get $3 million each? alan tudge: about a $3 million boost that they're going to get on average. neil mitchell: how do you make sure they just don't spend it on more mayoral lunches or cars or fat cat chief executives who are already overpaid? how do you make sure how they spend it? alan tudge: they have to put forward the series of projects that they want to spend their money on. now, we already have a formula for doing this called the roads to recovery money, where they get about $1 million each year from us already, and how that works is that they will put up their projects and as long as those projects fit within the criteria, they go ahead with them. so we don't select the projects as such, but we ensure that they are consistent with the guidelines. so this will almost be a quadrupling of the money which they will get from the federal government next financial year. so a big boost for them and we want to see those projects get under way as quickly as possible to provide what will be thousands of extra jobs and local stimulus at every single local town across victoria. neil mitchell: what sort of thing would you hope it to be spent on?\u00a0is it roads? is it parks?\u00a0what is it? alan tudge: a combination of things. so typically we give them money for roads. in this instance, we're broadening the criteria so it can be local roads that need to be fixed but also if they've got local community infrastructure which has been on the drawing board for a while but hadn't got the money for it.\u00a0 so this is an opportunity for that. neil mitchell: what, the local footy ground? alan tudge: or it could be community infrastructure such as that.\u00a0 neil mitchell: and improving the grandstand or something? alan tudge: yes, absolutely. neil mitchell: okay, roads, footy grounds, infrastructure, it can't be used in just day-to-day stuff like collecting the rubbish? alan tudge: no, it can't be used for operational expenses. it has to be for capital infrastructure and it has to be for projects which they otherwise wouldn't be doing. and so this is bringing forward and adding to the amount of activity which is going on. that's the whole idea of it, neil, is to create more economic activity, more jobs in every single location across the country. neil mitchell: okay.\u00a0can you be sure, though? i mean there's a habit in public service, \"oh, gee, we're coming to the end of the financial year.\u00a0 let's go and spend this money quickly because if we don't spend it we lose it.\"\u00a0can you be sure it will actually go on worthwhile projects? alan tudge: generally, yes, because we do have the guidelines and we already have a mechanism to do this.\u00a0we take a look at what they put up. we don't determine what their projects are, but as long as they fit within those guidelines and there's some surety around that, then we kick off on it and they get going and we do want to see them get cracking immediately though, because the job requirements are now and that's what this whole thing is about.\u00a0 neil mitchell: who overseas it? i'm not a great fan of local government and their waste, in fact i think we can do without them, but who oversees it? who makes sure they're actually spending where it has to be spent? alan tudge: it's a combination of two things, at the local council level they have their own integrity measures to ensure that if they are signing a contract with the federal government that they're abiding by that.\u00a0but equally, they will have to illustrate to the federal government departments as well precisely where they are going to spend their money and enter into a contract and have to abide by that contract.\u00a0 neil mitchell: any estimate how many jobs? alan tudge: no, it will be thousands of jobs but i don't have a precise estimate. neil mitchell: and how much money? alan tudge: so it's $500 million of new money of which about $100 million will go to victoria and then on top of that $1.3 billion of money which was in the out years if you like which we're bringing forward. neil mitchell: okay, but $500 million new money.\u00a0a listener wants to know if the federal government's likely to get money from china, we don't sign any belt and road deals, do we?\u00a0federally? alan tudge: no, we wouldn't do that and we've been critical of victoria signing up to that initiative. neil mitchell: why? alan tudge: well, it's an initiative which is a foreign policy tool for the chinese government, for the communist party, and it's not something that we have believed that australia should sign up to. neil mitchell: is it an attempt to buy influence in a state or i know some of the poorer countries are effectively taking them over. alan tudge: i mean it is a foreign policy tool of the chinese communist party government, of course, to have some influence. neil mitchell: so they're buying influence with it. alan tudge: it's a question for the victorian government as to why they signed up and other states have not signed up and the promise, of course, which has been documented in the newspapers, was that this was going to lead to better trade relationships.\u00a0 but that hasn't been the case and we've seen this already. neil mitchell: that's right. okay, do you think they've been spouting chinese propaganda as was alleged when tim pallas said it was the federal government fault that there was a tariff on barley? alan tudge: well, i mean i was pretty disappointed in those comments of tim pallas because we've taken the strong position in australia's interests and that position is not an unremarkable position to say that there should be an international inquiry into what occurred with this virus.\u00a0given the massive global devastation which the virus has caused, surely there should be an international inquiry into it. now, the world health organization has now agreed to that, which is good.\u00a0but we're always going to stand up for australia's interests and australia's values.\u00a0and to suggest that our standing up for australia's interests and australia's values is somehow - neil mitchell: i notice that china, through the global times, are saying it doesn't actually look at the origins of the virus but that's something else that's to be pursued elsewhere.\u00a0 and the other question is, well, if some of our borrowing will come from china, how much? what percentage? alan tudge: i don't know the answer to that question. i just don't know the answer to that question, neil. neil mitchell: okay. other thing, immigration. as you'd be aware, the property council wants a campaign to increase migration, to bring more migrants here post-pandemic. what's the right way to go post-pandemic, as it eases? do we increase migration or decrease migration? alan tudge: inevitably, it will be lower for some time to come. now, migration levels, in terms of net overseas migration, was tracking at, say, about 230,000 per annum. it is now almost zero because we have shut the borders and that was one of, if not, the most important thing we did to control the pandemic.\u00a0next financial year we're forecasting that migration will be 85% down on what was previously forecast.\u00a0 neil mitchell: for health reasons or economic reasons? alan tudge: no, largely for health reasons because our borders will still be closed and, you know, you think through where the various categories of migrants come into the visa classes. you just can't imagine having those sort of numbers coming into australia when we're coming from a zero position.\u00a0at the moment, we know that many of our source countries still have great difficulties in terms of the virus going through their countries, you know, think about india, for example, and so it will be still some time to come before we have open and free borders.\u00a0in fact, it may be that we need to have a global vaccine before we have open, free borders.\u00a0 neil mitchell: what, a global vaccine before we can return to full migration? alan tudge: before we can return to full free borders because, you know, when you think about it as well, most of our border crossings, neil, are actually from international tourists. we might say, have about 10 million border crossings from international tourists each year. now, that is a very difficult thing to do at the moment. neil mitchell: i understand that, but i'm looking at the migration thing. effectively, there's no migration until we get a vaccine, is that right? alan tudge: well, there will be some limited migration. so we already have, you know, a tiny bit of migration on an exemption basis whereby if somebody honestly believes that there are very compelling reasons to be in australia they can apply for an exemption. next year, we've already foreshadowed that we're examining some things such as can we progressively introduce international tourists, for example? can we have what we're calling a bubble arrangement with a country like new zealand or a pacific island which are very safe countries from a covid perspective as well, and have effectively free travel between those two countries? neil mitchell: but once we get through when they get a vaccine and open up the borders, do we then have a surge in the number of people being brought here to live, migrants, not tourists, migrants coming to live here?\u00a0do we for reasons of economy, as the property council says, do we need a surge in migration or do we set more carefully than that? alan tudge: i think it's very difficult to predict, neil, because it's still going to be some time away. i mean that presupposes that we do have a vaccine which is globally available because the migration system is quite complex and most people do come here on a short-term visa to start with before they might then apply for a permanent residency visa. so you've really got to look at each of those classes of short-term visas and what's likely there.\u00a0 now international students have been a great source of both income and people for australia, that's something that we could potentially get going and build up over time. you look at some of the skilled migration, now that will inevitably be down in any case because most of that is sponsored skilled migration, you can only sponsor if you can't find an aussie. now there will be a lot more aussies available over the next year or two so i imagine that will be down as well.\u00a0 neil mitchell: thank you for your time.\u00a0 alan tudge: thanks very much, neil.\u00a0 "], "transcript-sky-news-live-interview-tom-connell": ["20 May 2020", "tom connell:  emily, thank you. well, as restrictions ease, of course, and people get back to work there are real fears that our major cities will be choked with traffic because people will have less confidence in public transport with covid\u201119 still out there. joining me now is population, cities and urban infrastructure minister, alan tudge. thanks very much for your time. it has been described as potential 'carmageddon' in sydney and melbourne. do you share that concern? alan tudge:  i don't, tom. it's certainly, at the moment, the traffic is considerably less in both melbourne and sydney, which are the most heavily congested cities in australia. in fact, i am in sydney today, and speaking to the driver that i had this morning, he was saying it only took him 40 minutes to get from western sydney into the cbd in peak hour this morning when ordinarily it would take him an hour and 10 minutes so that's an indication at present. in the future, it is very difficult to predict. i mean, there's a real opportunity here i think, tom, for some of the flexibility in working arrangements to continue. we want people back to work, but they may be able to do so more flexibly, which may mean less traffic on the roads on an ongoing basis. tom connell:  so, when you say \"ongoing\", we're talking about beyond covid\u201119. let's imagine a wonderful world in which there's a vaccine and not talking about this dreaded thing anymore, how would that work? would we have a national framework? you know, if you're talking about a certain type of office job the employer has to offer split shifts; people can either go 7 to 3, or 10 to 6. they get one day maybe a fortnight where they can work from home. do we need a real framework to make this happen instead of just saying, \"hey, that was a great idea, keep doing it if you want to\"? alan tudge:  yeah, i'm not convinced that we do need a national framework as such. i think employers will respond to the desires of employees who, in many cases, want to work more flexibly. and if their productivity is the same, then it is probably good for the employee, which makes it good for the employer as well if that productivity is maintained. and so, there might be from the employer's perspective less need for as much property in some of the real expensive areas such as the cbds or some of the other employment centres. so, there might be benefits from the employer's perspective as well as in terms of lower costs if there's flexible working arrangements. i actually do think this will work itself out over the next 6, 12, 24 months where more flexible arrangements will become more of the norm amongst those employment relationships. tom connell:  right. do you think that, and yes, you've outlined pretty clear, standing from a financial point of view that always helps convince business, but if it just returns to normal and our streets are just as clogged and your poor drivers doing the hour 10 plus from western sydney, do we look at a framework? i mean, we're all talking about the national cabinet and people willing to cooperate now. surely there'd be an easy conversation to have if people are still willing to, you know, be better than the old coag. is it something you would look at? alan tudge:  i think the national cabinet has certainly worked exceptionally well throughout this period. i think there has been some arguments already made that this should continue, but the question about do you need a national framework to govern that flexible arrangements, i'm not convinced, but ultimately this would be more of a decision for the industrial relations minister in that regard as well. i suppose what i'm more concerned about actually, tom, in terms of congestion, at least in the short\u2011term, is more on public transport. now, our major cities, and particularly again if i focus on melbourne and sydney, are still very car dependent. about 75 per cent\u00a0sorry, 80 per cent of all travel in melbourne is done by cars. in sydney it is about two\u2011thirds. certainly of the people who work in the cbd, those figures are almost reverse, so about three quarters of people work in the cbd use public transport, and about two\u2011thirds in melbourne use public transport to get there. obviously the capacity of public transport is lower because of the social distancing and i think that presents challenges which we have to think carefully about and work through over the months and years ahead. tom connell:  and, well, we've known this for a little while, the new south wales plan, out just the other day, included a limit of 12 on buses but also a direction for no\u2011one to be refused entry on to a bus. that does not appear to make any sense at all, does it? alan tudge:  i personally didn't quite understand that one. i can appreciate maybe from a bus driver's perspective that they may be potentially concerned about their safety if they have to be\u00a0policing that as well, but that is really a matter for the state government in terms of how they negotiate those things. i think they are good rules in terms of ensuring that we can still travel on public transport in a safe way, and that is the most important thing, but clearly, the capacity of those buses will be down. clearly the capacity of the trains will be down and many of those trains in melbourne and sydney, certainly in melbourne,\u00a0are already at crush capacity in the mornings. so you take out half the capacity effectively. and it does mean some of that demand will go on the roads, and maybe that will offset what we're talking about before in terms of the flexible arrangements. tom connell:  right. alan tudge:  so i think it is a little bit of watch this space at the moment. tom connell:  but this is the worry for people out there. is there a bit of a concern for people out there, we're just not ready for it at the moment? and even on trains when the green sticker theory in sydney is great, but you've got to get on the train, look around, there's no sticker, the doors are closed, you know, on the train. it just doesn't seem like it is a workable policy. alan tudge:  yeah, i think that\u00a0the intent is certainly there and i admire the intent\u00a0for people to be able to commute safely on public transport. the operational aspects of that are obviously up to the state government, obviously up to the state governments and so i'll leave it to them to work out. tom connell:  yeah. alan tudge:  but as i said, at the moment we've probably got pressures on public transport because of that, we've got less pressure certainly at the moment on the roads, simply because so many people are still being able to work from home. tom connell:  just finally, property council sending alarm on prices, and part of its solution, it says, it might need to be an immigration campaign encouraging people to come to australia once the worst of the crisis has ended. is that something you would be up for, maybe a new twist on the 'where the bloody hell are you' campaign?

much for your time. alan tudge: g\u2019day tom. tom connell:\u00a0 we might begin on infrastructure. the stimulus measures we've got so far are very much short term for the economy. what about infrastructure? are we going to see a whole heap of projects brought forward? alan tudge: at the end of last year we announced $4.3 billion of extra funding to be brought forward, and that's being rolled out presently. we're also in discussions with states and territories right now in terms of other projects which may be able to be brought forward. you might recall that the dpm and myself wrote to our state counterparts and to the local councils a couple of months ago, even before the coronavirus kicked off. they've now come back which we're taking a look at. we are keen to get more infrastructure underway. and in part, tom, and this is important because it can be a good stimulus measure in and of itself, but also we know that the residential and commercial construction industry has slowed down. and so if we can mop up some of the workforce that would ordinarily work in that space, and put them towards the civil construction space, then we can help keep the economy going more rapidly. tom connell: yeah, because that was the report not so long ago - we were going to be short on actual workers for a lot of these infrastructure projects. that's now looking like the other way round, that there could be people heading to the unemployment queue because of that downturn you mentioned there unless there are projects ready to go. so you're confident there won't be a whole lot of people for a few months, at least, the unemployed from construction? are you going to be able to get this going quickly enough? alan tudge: tom, what i can say is that on the civil construction side, in relation to the roads, the rails, et cetera, all of that work continues at apace and there is definitely capacity there. in fact, there was a survey done by the civil contractors federation recently, which says that 90 per cent of their members had capacity to do more, which is a good sign. where the problems lie at the moment is more on the commercial and residential construction. and we know that when you look at the jobseeker figures, for example, over 10 per cent of the jobseeker applications have come from people in that sector indicating that there has been a market slowdown in that particular sector. that's why we are thinking about whether or not we can invest more in the civil construction - the roads, the rail, etcetera - in order to then be able to keep the employment market high in the overall construction industry. because construction, at the end of the day, is over 8 per cent of our gdp - 1.2 million people employed in that sector. we've done well to keep it going, and that's different to places like new zealand which shut down their construction industry overall. we've kept it going, largely at apace, but there has been that slowdown we do know in the commercial and residential construction area. [interview interrupted by news conference] tom connell: apologies to interrupt you there, minister alan tudge, i just wanted to make our viewers aware of that news conference. i know we spoke about population last time around and how things are looking very different. migrant workers obviously leaving, we don't know when they'll come back. are you going to have to possibly look at the opposite to what you're looking at not so long ago, boosting australia's population in the not too distant future? alan tudge: well, tom, as you probably know australia has been growing pretty quickly over the last decade or so - at about 1.6 per cent per annum - and two-thirds of that growth has been driven by migration into the country. now, clearly our migration rate will slow down this year because the borders are effectively closed at the moment, which means that that figure will obviously be down. now, we don't know when we'll be able open to open up the borders again. migration is an important element of our gdp growth - it's also supported skills, it's supported our universities, it's supported different sectors who are relying upon migrants to be able to do the work when they can't find australians. so we are looking closely at this as to what the future might unfold - how it might unfold, but we\u2019re just not position to be able to say that just yet while we still have the borders closed. tom connell:\u00a0 okay. so i guess there might be some incentives played around with, but that, that's an active situation to look at. i want to talk about racism, in particular against chinese-australians. i understand there's been a family targeted in your electorate. what's been happening there? alan tudge: yeah there has. it's something i've been concerned about generally actually, is that there's been a lot of evidence which i've been receiving that there has been an increase in racist attacks against, not just chinese-australians but other asian-australians. \u00a0that's just not on. there was a high profile incident in my own electorate, which is a very multicultural electorate - the eastern suburbs of melbourne - and i think it's just disgraceful conduct. i mean 99.9 per cent of australians are good honest people who would rightly abhor that type of racial abuse against asian people, but there's clearly a very, very small number of absolute cowards there who do cause significant grief and disharmony in our community. so we're trying to reassure the broader multicultural community, particularly the asian community, that we're on their side. there are mechanisms that you can take if you feel as if you're suffering from racial abuse as a result of the covid-19 crisis and we're encouraging them to do so. we're on their side. racism has no place in this country and i want to reassure them that it's just a tiny, tiny minority of people who, who are doing such cowardly conduct. tom connell:\u00a0 yeah. and if you're out there and you hear it, you know, don't be afraid to call it out as well. alan tudge: absolutely. i think most will do that, tom, as well, most decent australians would call it out when they see it and as rightly, they should. we've got the best multicultural country in the world and we want to continue that way and i think we can if people all call it out. tom connell: and just finally, minister angus taylor. we heard from new south wales police yesterday this document that he says his office downloaded from the sydney city council website, that police were unable to find any evidence that happened - no metadata anywhere in any of his office computers - that, that was taken from the sydney city website. so that's his explanation, i guess we'll never know, there's no proof of it. alan tudge: well i mean, what is very clear though, tom, is that there was a state police investigation and there was a federal police investigation and neither of them proceeded because neither of them found the evidence to suggest that he was doing anything wrong - and that should be the end of the matter. i know this constantly comes up, but it should be the end of the matter. you can't have a clearer case there. when the new south wales police investigated it, nothing turned down; federal police investigated it, nothing too progress with. that should be the end of the matter and i'm disappointed that the, the labor party persists in pursuing this for political reasons. tom connell:\u00a0 would it have been better for him to be more emphatic about putting it to bed and agreed to an interview with the police? he instead got police to ask questions via his lawyers. alan tudge: i think he fully cooperated with the police is my full understanding and i have no reason to doubt that he fully cooperated in that basis. i'll just re-emphasise, the fact of the matter is there's been two full police investigations and in both cases he was cleared and so that should be the end of the matter and labor should stop politicising this. tom connell: alan tudge, appreciate your time. thank you. alan tudge: thanks very much, tom.

ongoing challenges in the sector as a result of the pandemic. mr mccormack said construction is key to navigating australia out of the pandemic while maintaining jobs and economic growth. \u201calmost 110,000 people are employed in heavy and civil engineering construction in australia and if you include the transport, postal and warehousing sector that amounts to more than seven per cent of gdp and accounts for around eight per cent of employment,\u201d mr mccormack said. \u201cdesigning and constructing infrastructure is vital to australia\u2019s immediate and long-term future and we are committed to ensuring our record $100 billion pipeline stays on track during this time. \u201cthe health and safety of workers and the community remains our priority and it is pleasing the sector has implemented measures so it can continue operating under new social-distancing rules. \u201cthe federal government has recently called on our states and territories and the 537 local governments to ask them what infrastructure can be brought forward. we are now assessing that infrastructure with responses received from three-quarters of the local councils.\u201d there are around 160 major projects currently underway including the western sydney international (nancy bird-walton) airport and the 1700-kilometre inland rail project. mr tudge said a huge proportion of the economy relies on the construction and infrastructure sector. \u201ccovid-19 has had an unprecedented impact on australian businesses, individuals and our economy which is why a strong construction sector is so important to maintain jobs and industry confidence,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cwe have been working closely with industry since the outbreak of this pandemic to ensure a considered and responsible national response, whilst ensuring the health and safety of employees and the broader community. \u201cwe want this crucial job sector to be maintained and remain as strong as ever so we are in a much better position to come out of covid-19 and get our economy back on track. \u201cthe liberal and nationals government will continue working with local and state and territory governments to ensure we address challenges promptly so the sector can continue to thrive.\u201d infrastructure partnerships australia ceo adrian dwyer said the focus on keeping construction going has been vitally important for the sector and the economy. \u201cby maintaining a focus on the pipeline of existing projects and supporting the acceleration of new investments, the federal government has been able to keep the wheels on the construction sector,\u201d mr dwyer said. \u201cit\u2019s not just about the 1.3 million people employed in the sector, it\u2019s the flow-on effect to their families and the broader economy which makes it so important that we maintain a strong and viable sector through the covid-19 crisis and out the other side.\u201d deputy prime minister \u2013 tess salmon 0467 740 017 minister tudge \u2013

saw the prime minister at his media conference yesterday, or you might have seen reports on it, be you might have seen him on '7:30' last night with leigh sales, but as we start to see an outline of the path out of the current lockdowns, just how to get the economy back on track becomes an increasingly urgent question, and one of the key growth drivers of the economy is population. and coronavirus is set to be driving the biggest population decline in australian history. we've been joined by alan tudge, the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure and he's also the acting immigration minister. alan tudge, welcome. alan tudge:  g'day, ali. ali moore: can i just ask you, first of all, i know it's slightly off and not completely connected to your portfolios, but you are a member of the federal government, paid pandemic leave for workers in a health setting? alan tudge: well, i mean that would be up to the individual organisation to make those decisions. ali moore: well there's an application before the fair work commission to have it inserted in awards. would you support it, though, on a principle? alan tudge: listen, you've just caught me literally in this moment putting this to me. i haven't thought deeply about it and obviously this would be a decision which the industrial relations minister would have to make and would take to the cabinet, i think, before making such a call. ali moore: in principle? alan tudge: again, i'd just have to think through it. you've only just sort of pitched to me immediately. ali moore: i've caught you on the hop. alan tudge: and i don't want to say something which then would be taken out of context and you're always saying that you want members of parliament, and particularly ministers, to think through the decisions. i don't want to make a decision on the hop. ali moore: okay, sorry, i didn't think it was that hard a question, actually. but, alan tudge, let's get to your portfolio. as i just said, one of the biggest - or the biggest population declines in australian history. how many tourists and temporary workers and students have left the country? alan tudge: so we've seen a decline from about 2.4 million people who were here at christmas to about 2.1 million people today. now, typically we have a decline between christmas and now in any case but not usually as steep. the biggest components of that by far in a way is international tourists who, by and large, are taking the opportunity to jump on flights and exit the country to their home country, and i think that's a sensible thing. it's something that we have suggested to those people, particularly if they haven't got family support because many people are concerned that there may not be flights in the future and so in which case it's best to take that opportunity now to leave the country. ali moore: you said international tourists, what about international students? alan tudge: international student numbers are still hovering at about 560,000 people and they've declined slightly, some have left but not too many. i mean most people obviously come at the start of the year for the academic year, and we still have very significant numbers here who are studying, many of them are studying from a distance perspective, obviously, now, but are still learning and that's a good thing. ali moore: there is obviously some of these gaps in the assistance packages that the government's provided and temporary visa holders, many of them foreign students, are, you know, well and truly fall into those gaps and they are being told to go home if they can't support themselves here. they can't all go home, as we know, and if i can just put one group, which i know you're very well aware of, indian students, they have no opportunity to go home because their country is very much locked and bolted even to their own citizens. alan tudge: yeah, india's an unusual case. in most instances, there still are flights to other countries, into europe, into many asian countries and to the united states, etcetera. india is unusual in terms of it has closed down its international airports, as you say, so even indian citizens cannot get into the country. and that's different, you know, even to australia. obviously australia, we have our borders closed but if you're an australian citizen or a permanent resident you can come in after you've done your two weeks quarantine. we're cognisant of this. the indian government had said that they were going to lift the restrictions on their international airports at the beginning of this week. they've actually extended it for a couple more weeks and so it's a watching brief on that. more generally, though, for those students, we've said, particularly for the first year students of which the significant number are, our expectation is that you can look after yourself because that's what you declared in your visa application. ali moore: but what about the other - the second and third year? alan tudge: the subsequent year students, the second, third and fourth year students, we've said that please utilise the savings which you may have available, please go to your families and get their support. we will give you access to your own superannuation which you may have acquired while being here for the last couple of years and you may have a few thousand dollars there. go to your universities and they are offering hardship payments and they've already announced $110 million of hardship payments. ali moore: but nothing else from the government? alan tudge: not at this stage and we've said publicly as well that we will continue to engage with the international education sector. ali moore: but time is of the essence, obviously. alan tudge: well, it is, but universities themselves are stepping up as well and that's a good thing. as i said, they've already announced $110 million of hardship payments so that's a good thing for them to be able to do. ali moore: so you've said that of the people who are leaving a lot of international tourists have left, you've made the point, not so many students have left. alan tudge: no. ali moore: so when you see modelling such as that of victoria university's mitchell institute, which we're going to look at much more closely a little later in the program, but they're saying that the university sector is likely to be hit to the tune of around $19 billion by this, and a lot of that is loss of international students. do you not see it as being such a significant impact? alan tudge: well, their modelling assumes that next year there will not be a single new international student come into the country. so that's a very conservative estimate. we don't know at this stage what next year is going to look like but we've always talked about a six-month timeframe here in terms of trying to get through this pandemic. just yesterday the prime minister said that within four weeks if our preconditions are met, we may be able to start to relax some of the restrictions. so we've got to take that modelling with a grain of salt, we just simply don't know. at the same time we have said to the universities and we've announced a package for them already which does guarantee their domestic fee income for at least the rest of this year and that's about $18 billion in total. so, i see that modelling done, let's just look at it very carefully and cautiously, though. ali moore: regardless of what that modelling says, we know that information international students, international travellers are incredibly important - alan tudge:  absolutely. ali moore: - to helping to grow our economy which is incredibly important to coming out the other side of this. do you worry we won't see the numbers of new international students? not to say there won't be any, but we won't see the sorts of numbers we've seen in the past, and in part, because we have not been generous, we have basically said to them look, great, you've been fuelling our economy, we love that but now you're in trouble go home? alan tudge: i am concerned more generally that two important export markets, being international students and international visitors, are obviously being hit at the moment and significantly, and we'd like that to rebound in the future, of course we would. in terms of your latter question, will it be related to the comments that we've made; i don't believe so. because the normal expectation for all people who come here on short-term visas is that they are able to look after themselves. ali moore: in the first year only, though. that's always been - alan tudge: no, no, it's always been the case across the board for all short-term visa holders. whether you're an international tourist or a backpacker or someone on a skilled visa or if you're an international tourist, the expectation is that you will always be able to look after yourselves. we give those people work rights, often they will get medicare or they will be required to have private health insurance, but they're asked to look after themselves and we're maintaining that expectation at the moment because we're prioritising, obviously, both the jobs and the welfare dollars to australians and permanent residents. the international students are a special case, in part because they're so valuable to australians. and that's why we've said quite clearly for the second, third and fourth years, use those other resources, we'll give you access to your super, go to your universities who are already setting up hardship payments and the government will continue to engage with the international education sector because it is such an important sector, ali, so we're keeping a watching eye on this and very close eye on it. ali moore: alan tudge, thank you very much for talking to us. no doubt we'll talk to you again as we follow the path out of all of this. alan tudge: yes, thanks very much, ali.

said. \u201cthe morrison government\u2019s commitments along the m1 will support thousands of jobs in the construction industry at a time when long-term stability and security is needed as we continue to see upgrades to the m1 roll out from brisbane to the new south wales border. \u201cit\u2019s part of our $100 billion infrastructure pipeline that is just as important now, as ever.\u201d the australian government committed $115 million towards the upgrade that supported 131 jobs over the life of the project. following the completion of the m1/m3 gateway merge, preliminary works have now begun on the next stage of the m1 north upgrade's $749 million eight mile plains to daisy hill (emp2dh) project. queensland transport and main roads minister mark bailey said the job-boosting progress being made was a reflection of the queensland government's commitment to building a better m1. \u201cwe want to assure queenslanders that despite our focus on managing the response to the covid-19 pandemic, we're progressing critical road infrastructure projects like these across the state,\u201d mr bailey said. \u201cthe construction industry plays an essential role in keeping the state\u2019s economy powering so we can\u2019t lose momentum delivering our record investment in major infrastructure for queensland. \u201cour government\u2019s partnership with the australian government has delivered the biggest program of upgrades to the m1 since the highway was first built. \u201cupgrades in this scale require significant planning and preparation and of course interrupt traffic during construction, so it is particularly pleasing to announce that we have successfully delivered the first of these m1 upgrades ahead of schedule.\u201d federal member for forde bert van manen said early works had already started on the next m1 upgrade between eight mile plains and daisy hill, which has received a commitment of $375 million from the australian government. \u201cthe sports drive to gateway motorway project is the first package of work within the broader eight-kilometre eight mile plains to daisy hill upgrade, which will see reduced congestion and improved travel times for commuters on this stretch of the m1 pacific motorway,\u201d mr van manen said. state member for springwood mick de brenni welcomed the news that commuters would be able to get home to their families sooner thanks to the hard work of local tradies.\n\u00a0\n\u201cmy wife and i grew up watching the south east freeway being built in the eighties,\u201d mr de brenni said. \u201cwe remember riding push bikes along it when it was just a dirt track.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cto see my commitment to deliver a better m1 being delivered, and ahead of schedule, supporting jobs, is personally satisfying. \u201ci\u2019ve done the commute along the m1 to springwood my entire working life and know exactly what getting this job done means to locals.\u201d bielby holdings has been awarded the first package of work on the eight mile plains to daisy hillupgrade, which will stretch about 3.5 kilometres from sports drive, underwood, to the gateway motorway interchange. bielby holdings managing director adam edwards said they were delighted to secure the sports drive to gateway motorway package of work. \"we are thrilled to continue our relationship with the department of transport and main roads, as we build a vital piece of infrastructure for south-east queensland,\u201d mr edwards said. the eight mile plains to daisy hill upgrade is set to create more than 720 jobs. further south, the pacific motorway (m1) upgrade between varsity lakes and tugun is now also a step closer to construction. the contract to upgrade the first section between varsity lakes and burleigh has been awarded to seymour whyte constructions, which will support almost 850 jobs. works are due to start on the $1.03 billion m1 varsity lakes to tugun upgrade in mid-2020, after the current upgrade between mudgeeraba

"transcript-sky-news-interview-tom-connell": ["16 April 2020", "tom connell: let's go to our next guest on the program.\u00a0this is amidst reports of, well, the population outbreak in australia, remember the carefully calibrated plan from the government to make sure population growth didn't happen too quickly? it's now the opposite, reports 300,000 fewer people in the country already as a result of coronavirus and that could double by the end of the year.\u00a0minister alan tudge has been good enough to join me now.\u00a0thanks very much for your time. can you confirm the numbers we've seen here this morning, that this is a result of temporary visa holders mainly and that we've got 300,000 already going, another 300,000 possibly by the end of the year? alan tudge: yeah, tom, that's right.\u00a0so, since the start of the year until now we've had about 300 - we have about 300,000 fewer temporary migrants in the country.\u00a0now, the vast majority of those were actually - are actually international visitors. now, we typically have a decline from the peak over christmas until now in any case.\u00a0we've had a sharper decline this year and for obvious reasons; and that is that people are exercising their choice to go home early where they may be able to get stronger support back home. and we've obviously been making that message heard loudly and clearly too; that for those international tourists right here, particularly those who don't have family support in australia, they should consider going back home to their home country where they can get that support. tom connell: so, when you still make that urging, because the prime minister made it as well, was it known how many people would leave as a result?\u00a0was that decision made despite possible impacts on the economy? alan tudge: we - we obviously are aware of when people's visas expire in any case, so we can see the pattern of the expiration over the months ahead.\u00a0and so, most visitors who come out here are on a three-month visa, and you can see those visas expiring.\u00a0 the issue is that we haven't got any new people coming into the country which typically balances out the people exiting.\u00a0we closed the borders for a reason, as you know.\u00a0we initially did that with china and now for the whole world, and only allowing australians with permanent residence into the country. so, of course that does have an impact, an economic impact when you don't have the tourists in the country.\u00a0and on the other side, of course, we want those tourists back.\u00a0but in the meantime, the decision was made to ask them to return to their home countries because they can't travel in the country in any case. they may find themselves without a flight to get home at some stage in the future, and so in which case the advice was: get home, be safe, have the support\u2026back in your home country. tom connell: what sort of impact will it have on the economy?\u00a0there's already talk about housing, for example.\u00a0congestion and housing were two of the things you were trying to address.\u00a0i suppose in one way they'll be addressed, but is there a concern housing will go too far in terms of a correction?\u00a0we know how important it is for the economy.\u00a0 alan tudge: yeah, clearly population has been an economic driver for the country and two-thirds of our population growth is driven by migration.\u00a0so, if the migration rate declines then that will have an overall impact on the economy. we understand that.\u00a0that's well known.\u00a0the precise impact we don't know yet.\u00a0we'll be making the updates in the budget in terms of what the migration rate forecast will be and the population rate forecast will be.\u00a0we'll still have population growth because a third of our population growth is through natural growth, people having babies, and the life expectancy extending.\u00a0 so that will still occur and that still provides economic opportunities.\u00a0what our migration program looks like post-coronavirus, though, is really too early to say at this stage. but we're very much focused on the here and now in terms of focusing on australians and permanent residents, making sure we've still got sufficient people to work in those critical industries such as health, such as agriculture, and aged care, disability care, etcetera. tom connell: right. alan tudge: while at the same time saying to those temporary migrants, those short-term visitors -- tom connell: yeah. alan tudge: \u00a0-- that if you're concerned about your economics circumstances then you may consider returning home where you can get that support. tom connell: is there a big concern now for regions in particular?\u00a0you're already trying to push more people out there. now the attraction of less traffic, for example, there'll be less traffic in cities anyway, and a lot of jobs as well were tied to tourism in the regions.\u00a0so, could they suffer more than the rest of the country and do you have a plan for that? the hon alan tudge: it's, it's a good question, tom.\u00a0to be honest, it's really too early to tell the exact economic consequences region by region.\u00a0obviously, our - our plan pre coronavirus was to try to grow the population in some of those regional areas, and many of those regional areas wanted to grow; try to grow the populations in places like adelaide where premier marshall was clearly looking to grow south australia's population more rapidly.\u00a0 now, again, things are obviously different now during this pandemic and it's too early to say what it might look like post the pandemic when we get back to normal.\u00a0that, in part, will be - at least our forecast will be outlined in the budget in october in terms of what we expect, but then in terms of what that distribution looks like we'll have to consider that in due course as well. tom connell: yeah, i suppose, look, a lot of things have changed, so a new plan will be needed; population and cities, minister alan tudge, thanks for your time today. alan tudge: thanks very much, tom.

alan tudge: two things. one, it's highly unlikely we'll go backwards because our population growth is driven by two things, one being migration and the other being natural increase. migration accounts for about two thirds, natural increase a third. so we'll still continue to - tom elliott: but i gather people aren't having as many children in these uncertain times either? alan tudge: that typically happens as well. certainly in previous recessions around the world people tend to have fewer children because of economic uncertainty. but we just obviously don't know that. we won't know that for some time. but getting back to the economic question, is it a problem if the population stagnates? well, population is one of our big economic drivers, as you'd know, and it's a driver overall in terms of increasing the gdp but it has had an impact also in terms of increasing the gdp per capita, i.e. it's made each of us individually wealthier. so it's been good for australia but obviously because we're not - because the borders are closed we haven't got new people coming into the country at the moment and meanwhile we still have people exiting the country and so consequently the net migration rate is in the negative at the moment. tom elliott: so let's go through the categories. i mean there's a lot of international students who physically weren't able to get here before the borders closed so they haven't taken up their places at universities. our universities are crying poor as a result. there's tourists, obviously, which, you know, why would you come here if you're going to have to undergo a 14-day quarantine and then you've got temporary workers, they'd struggle to find a job, wouldn't they? alan tudge: well, many of them - there's about 137,000 temporary workers at the moment on, you know, two or four-year skilled visas. now, some of those will be laid off and some of them might be stood down. if you're laid off they will have to leave the country and meanwhile, right at the moment, new people aren't coming in. so we will see a decline there. with international students, there's just under 600,000 international students in the country at the moment. you're right, there's still some which were stranded offshore and couldn't get into the country. by and large, those numbers are still pretty stable and we hope that that will remain that way because they have been a great source of revenue for australia, and indeed, some of them do stay on and become australian citizens. tom elliott: isn't the problem there that a lot of them depend on getting part-time jobs and usually that's in hospitality or in shops or even driving cabs or whatever and they just can't get those jobs right now? alan tudge: yeah, that is an issue. now, if you're an international student you're eligible to work 20 hours per week maximum and often that's - often the students do utilise those hours and some of them obviously haven't got those hours at the moment. we've actually said to them utilise your savings, call on your family support, we'll give you access to any superannuation that you might have accumulated while you've been here and in addition the universities now are putting in place hardship provisions. so they've already announced $110 million into some hardship provisions to assist those international students. tom elliott: okay, but big picture, i mean obviously not having students coming in and not having - not having students coming in, not having temporary workers coming in, not having tourists coming in, it's all bad for the economy and i'm just adding to the list of things right now that are bad for the economy. i know the prime minister spoke today about our next step will be to plan for our way out of this but i mean how long are we talking about? because i don't know, you sort of live in this canberra bubble where everybody has a job and everybody gets paid and the money just comes out of the grateful taxpayers' pockets, but the reality is our economy is really hurting right now, like whether it's lack of immigrants or lack of tourists, anywhere you point. i mean, when are we going to start changing things? alan tudge: well, the prime minister just announced today that we may see some changes within four weeks. now, there's three preconditions to that happening. firstly, we need to have a much more broad scale testing regime which we're working on presently. second, we need to have a tracing regime so that if a virus does spring up somewhere it can be traced and the people that that person's been connected to can be identified and that's where our tracing app is leading towards. and, thirdly, we need to have a mechanism for rapid response. so if there is a breakout in a particular geographical area, we could almost lock down that particular geographical area so it doesn't spread. now, assuming those three preconditions are met and we're hopeful they can be in the next few weeks, then we're in the position to start looking at relaxing some of the restrictions. in the meantime, though, as well, tom, the state premiers, and obviously including premier andrews here in victoria, are going to reconsider some of the restrictions which they've put in place above and beyond the national restrictions and victoria's actually been one of the most restrictive places in australia and so they've said that they would consider some of those things even before that time. tom elliott: okay, but, again, i mean, in the national cabinet, i'm not sure if you're part of that or not, but i mean, you know, you are going to have, like, as it is, the unemployment rate is probably 10% right now and would be 15% except that the people who get the jobkeeper allowance don't officially count as unemployed, even though they're not really doing any work. i mean, is there a sense of urgency here? because it's fine to say we've got to squash the disease and flatten the curve and all that sort of thing but as i see it from the ground, you've just got - i'm seeing businesses left, right and centre shutting their doors and most of them will not reopen and all the people they employ will not be able to get jobs. i'm beginning to wonder whether the cost of that is possibly worse than the disease itself? alan tudge: yeah, tom, we're certainly very conscious of this and there is a sense of urgency. i mean there's been a sense of urgency right from the get-go. now, i think australians and victorians can be assured that we've done almost better than any other country in the world at suppressing the virus and minimising the number of deaths and when you look across to places like new york or you look at places like italy or spain, they are not places where you want to be and we are nowhere near that. so i think we can have a level of comfort that we're in this position and everybody's contributed to that. now, there is that very rapid thinking in relation to the road out, if you like, and the prime minister's just signalled today what those three preconditions are and that can start potentially in four weeks' time. i think, however, though, and in four weeks' time we can start looking at what measures we can take to unwind it and get the economy as much as possible back to normal. i think, though, tom, in terms of some of those things like the social distancing, you know, having to stay 1.5 metres apart, i mean that's likely to be with us really until we get a vaccine. so that could be some time even beyond that four-week mark. so, we're on the pathway, we're now thinking about the road out but we've also just got to be realistic and set realistic expectations here as well. tom elliott: appreciate your time. alan tudge there, minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure.

official sod turning of the utas transformation project. it's been some time in coming and it's a very exciting day for launceston. i've got minister alan tudge here with me, city of launceston mayor albert van zetten, infrastructure minister michael ferguson and, of course, rufus black, who is going to tell us how we've got to this point. rufus? rufus black:\nthank you, bridget. this really is an exciting day for launceston and it's an exciting day for the north of tasmania and it's a really exciting day for the whole state. this is the cornerstone project that gets our whole transformation to move the university here to inveresk underway. the building that we are building here that is going to get underway is our student library and student experience building. a truly beautiful response to this remarkable kind of context here, talking to the old buildings that are all around us and yet are fully equipped to provide the most contemporary kind of learning spaces that students could want. a building not just for students but a building also for the community that provides a really important facility that will be the cornerstone of this campus. so, it's a real thrill to see this happen. but these kind of projects don't happen without the extraordinary group of people coming together and so it's a real delight for us today to have so many of the people who have been supporting and making this happen. this is a project of every level of government. we've had incredible support from the commonwealth, wonderful support from the state and an absolute power of work by the local council and local councilors who have made such a difference to actually working this through, to create a building that is a real response, not just to the needs of the university but also to the community's hopes and aspirations for it. we would not be here today without all of those levels of government collaborating around a sense of what education can do for tasmania, for launceston, indeed for the state. that shared vision of how it can be transforming our society, our economy, helping to revitalise it, to add energy and growth, create next generation of jobs here and, of course, to support greater social inclusion. all of that happens when the levels of government come together around an exciting vision of what education can do for a community. so today the university is here with gratitude and thanks for all of that help, all of that support, all of that collaboration. ours is a day of appreciation for what\u2019s got us here and we look forward to pursuing that vision in collaboration with the community in just the same ways that got us here today. so, it's my pleasure to introduce to you the honourable alan tudge to say some words for the commonwealth. thank you. alan tudge:\nthank you so much, rufus. it\u2019s great to be here with my colleagues bridget and wendy along with michael and albert, the mayor, for this very exciting day. i thank you for putting on such beautiful weather for us here today as well. this is a tremendous day for launceston and for tasmania. from what i'm advised, this is the single largest infrastructure project in launceston's history which we are kicking off today. $260 million worth. half of that is from the commonwealth government, the rest from the other partners of whom is represented here today, including the university of tasmania. this is all about jobs. it's about boosting the economy and it's about providing more opportunities for young people here in tasmania. it's particularly about jobs. in the short-term, this is going to create 430 jobs during the construction phase. 20 per cent of those jobs are going to be apprentices and trainees. in the longer term there is going to be 230 ongoing jobs at the university site, which comes about from this project. so it's jobs now and its jobs for the future and it's creating opportunities for young people. that's what this partnership is about between the three levels of government and the university of tasmania. it's so exciting because in 2032 when it's all completed, up and running and it's at full development, we'll have an extra 10,000 students studying here at the university of tasmania, here in launceston, interacting in with industry, to cutting edge research, international students coming here and providing opportunities for young people across tasmania as well. i really just want to thank the university of tasmania led by rufus black who is such a dynamic vice chancellor for the work, which he has done to get us to this particular point in time. i also want to thank the partnership that we have with the tasmanian government along with the local council in pulling this together. it really is a great partnership this effort, and of course, it's the centerpiece of the overall launceston city deal, which is aiming at transforming and boosting launceston over the years ahead. so it's really great to be here to kick this off, turn the first sod and in 2024 it will be exciting to be back here and to officially open this for new students, for the greater opportunities which this presents for launceston. michael ferguson:\nthank you, alan. it's a fantastic day. it's a beautiful day because of the weather but it was also a beautiful day yesterday when it was pouring with rain and i know our farmers really appreciated the soaking. but it's a special day because today we celebrate the fact that the talk is over, the budget preparations are done, the planning has been completed and we are actually now down to work. as alan has said, it's exciting to see the partnership delivering hundreds of new jobs. it does include 80 new apprenticeships here on site and as we today kick off the library and student experience building and together within the next few weeks the commencement of the new bridge across the north esk river, this is about connecting this campus really to the heart of launceston. and it's about sending a very clear message to tasmanians, young and older tasmanians that education is for you. it is our future, whether it's an academic or a vocational pathway, we value all of our jobs and the contribution that everybody can make to our economy. vitally as well, it's a partnership that has seen massive investment in our city. we are seeing the partnership model develop to such a point that it is the centerpiece of the city deal that has been struck between the three levels of government and the university, of course, has been central to that. i do want to say a big thank you to my parliamentary colleagues, particularly bridget archer and senator wendy askew and, of course, the premier who have been so instrumental from the tasmanian government's point of view in bringing the parties together. but we could not have done this without the commonwealth. and so bridget archer and alan tudge, it's been fantastic to work with you and the energy that we've been each able to bring this, including through the office of coordinator general has been absolutely phenomenal. so as i conclude, i will make the point that there has been a lot of discussion. there has been a lot of community consultation. there has been a lot of interest. there has been supporters and there have been the detractors. but now we deliver this project and we can all look forward to the completion of this fantastic redevelopment of inveresk and indeed the transformation of the university here and see a vital student learning and research, the excitement that can come from more generations of tasmanians seeing their future life potential being achieved through better education pathways. and from that point of view the tasmanian government is a proud contributor of the $60 million towards this project and we want to wish it all the very best into the future. thank you. mayor albert van zetten:\ni agree with everything that has been said and a little bit more. no, it\u2019s absolutely fantastic and as a city we have been extremely pleased to work through a process and it has been a process. i want to thank my councilors that are here, councillor mckenzie and finlay in particular, who have been part of that working group. working very hard along with many at the university to make sure we can iron out those differences that we've had over the journey, and there have been some differences and different ways of doing things, but it's been fantastic the last few years the way we've been able to work extremely well together and make sure that we deliver, as has been said, not just the building and the jobs for the next number of years when the building is happening but also for me it's the long-term impact on our community. the long\u00acterm impact of helping people through education, realising that there are so many people in northern tasmania, and it's not just about launceston, but northern tasmania that do not go on to further education. that is something that is an issue that affects a lot of things in our community, including health. so this is so important for the city. it's really great that we've finally got to this stage. i will be more excited even still once, we see the opening because i think that is always the better stage, to see the opening and see it happen. i want to thank obviously the city deal that we've had with the federal government. the city deal is continuing to deliver for our city. this is one of the projects, obviously a major one, but the city deal has other projects to do with the tamar estuary, our city heart projects to do with our northern suburbs revitalisation. we want to continue to work together to ensure that we get that investment of the dollars into this city to make this community an even better community than what it is today. we are a great city, a beautiful city and a normal day in this city, as each of you know, this is a normal beautiful day in our great city and it's something that we want to continue to develop for launceston to be one of the great regional cities of the world.\n\u00a0\nthat's something that we continue to work on and continue to work with and this project will help us to do that along with all the other projects. so to everybody involved, thank you very much and it's been exciting to work with the liberal government, state and federal to get this city deal and we stress how important that's been to our city and how important it's going to be for the next five to six years as well. thank you.\n\u00a0 "],

will be improved for the pedestrians who are crossing this road. \nfrom a jobs perspective, 700 jobs will be created during the construction phase of this project alone. and of course, by making the road more efficient it adds to the productive capacity of the economy overall. now, the federal government has a massive infrastructure program going on across the country as we speak, supporting 80,000 jobs already. this is a further 700 jobs on top of that. and obviously getting people home sooner by making the road networks more efficient. again, i would like to thank the state government for their cooperative approach to dealing with these particular projects, particularly minister saffioti, she and i worked together very closely in relation to projects like this. it will be a great project. it\u2019s being done quickly \u2013 in 18 months, it will be completed \u2013 and it's going to make a real difference to the lives of people down in this part of western australian. \nrita saffioti:\nthank you. \ncan i thank the federal minister and also the federal government for their partnership in this project. can i also thank the city of fremantle for their work working with the state government in getting this project to this stage. many of you would be aware of this project. this has been off and on for over a decade, but we are now at a project that is starting construction and will deliver significant benefits. this is a project we committed to at the election, and as has been outlined, there will be massive safety improvements. a number of other key features will be the local access road to the north side of high street, which will allow the residents to use a local access road to get to their homes. there will also be more parking and better access for netball, and we have seen the thousands of people that come to the netball every weekend. there will be a new roundabout at stirling highway and there will be a new bypass lane for vehicles traveling through to fremantle. \nas has also been noted, it's undulating, and so we'll be flattening the land too, to reduce those slopes and make it safer for trucks. so this is a really, really good project for wa; for the freight industry but also for the local residents. as i said, it's a complex project and we've worked really well with the community. two new underpasses have been added in as part of our consultation. we're retaining many of the trees in the area, the trees will form a part of the new median strip. \nso it will make it far more efficient and safe in this area. it's a key election commitment, and can i thank main roads so far for their work in consulting with the community, and also georgiou as the contracting company undertaking the project. so far, this project has been managed very well and we expect to see it up and running early next year. so a great project for wa, a great project for fremantle and for the local area, and another election commitment that we committed to being delivered and a great partnership with the federal government. \nbrad pettit:\ni'd also like to thank both the federal government and the state government for this. this is a really important project for fremantle. it would be fair to say that it has been one of the key both safety and congestion points that has plagued this area for decades. and what's really exciting about this is we\u2019ve got an outcome that is, i think, really good for the freight industry but also really good for local residents. in fact, there was a really, i think, a quite innovative design process, where main roads actually worked with the local community to come up with some of the key design elements around retaining trees, pedestrian underpasses and some other elements that i think have really seen this project have some really strong local support. \nit's going to be a good project and it\u2019s going to make a really important change to this area and really looking forward to seeing it going ahead over the next 18 months. thank you. journalist:\nwith this project and the other freeway upgrades, when can people expect to actually start benefiting from reduced travel times? \nrita saffioti:\nyeah along the freeway, we'll see some real benefits flow in second half of this year. but there are a number of projects across the network; as we've seen the we\u2019ve got the freeway upgrades, both south and north, we've got the murdoch drive connection which will be completed soon. across the suburbs, the tonkin highway connection to muchea will be opening in the next month. the wanneroo road overpasses will be opening at the end of this year. so i think by the end of this year people will see the true significance of the projects that have been undertaken, and the savings to their time \u2013 savings in their precious family time. and what we're seeing is upgrades across the entire suburban network in partnership with the federal government. so there will be, of course, further disruption because of the metronet projects really being underway and other new road projects as well, as we keep rolling them out. \nbut what we'll start seeing by the end of this year is significant time savings and reduced congestion over the network. \nin relation to the freeway, the level of work on the freeway is unprecedented. that level work hasn't been seen for over a decade. so it really is much needed infrastructure, short term pain but long term gain. and what we'll see is much more free flowing, a reduction in many of the bottlenecks. and of course with smart freeways the introduction of technology used in other states, such as in melbourne and in sydney \u2013 new technology being applied to our freeway to better inform drivers about how to travel in the fastest possible way.\u00a0 \njournalist:\npremier, can i ask you a question on another matter? \nmark mcgowan:\nsure but you want to finish with this one first?\u00a0 \njust in closing i forgot to thank the builders, georgiou, for coming on board. a very good western australian company who won this contract and i'm sure they'll do an outstanding job. and obviously just to reflect to one of your questions: look there's a lot of roadworks going on, we know that. and we know a lot of people find it frustrating. but you know, there's no gain without pain, and the gains will be enormous once these road works are finished.\u00a0 [unrelated content exempted] journalist:\nminister tudge, can i just ask you: was it appropriate for bridget mckenzie to approve an award, a grant, to the wangaratta clay target shooting club \u2013 a club of which she was a member? should she resign in relation to that revelation today? \nalan tudge:\nwell, as you know, every single decision which she had made had been assessed as being eligible for receiving money. and in relation to her honorary membership, which she had received from that club, she wasn't obliged to disclose that under the senate rules, and so she continued to make the decisions in accordance with the rules, and she's outlined those very clearly.\u00a0 \njournalist:\nare you generally saying that that\u2019s appropriate? how can you say that that's appropriate? \nalan tudge:\nwell, there's rules in the senate as to what you need to disclose and what you don't. in this instance, the value of the membership was well under $300 and so you don't have to disclose memberships which are below that amount.\u00a0 \njournalist:\nshe was a member of the club and she awarded a grant to the club. \nalan tudge:\ni think she had been made an honorary member of the club.\u00a0 \njournalist:\nas a member. \nalan tudge:\nshe hadn't had to disclose the membership because of the senate rules and she's made that clear. \njournalist:\ndo you agree with those rules? \nalan tudge:\nwell they are the senate rules. they apply to all of us. for the house of reps, we have to disclose as well if we receive any gifts. you do that if they\u2019re above a certain amount of money. \njournalist:\n[inaudible] \nalan tudge:\nbut i just reconfirmed, as well, that every single decision that she had made in relation to those grants had been assessed as being eligible to receive payments. i mean, just in this electorate alone i think there's four clubs in it that received payments under that scheme and that will make a big difference to those clubs to support, particularly, female participation and female change rooms, which is so necessary right across the country.\u00a0 \njournalist:\nwe\u2019re asking about this particular grant, and do you think that with general public, that that kind of technical argument really washes with the general public? \nalan tudge:\nwell, i\u2019ve provided my answer to that. \njournalist:\nshe just took it on herself to prioritise, didn't she? with advice?\u00a0 \nalan tudge:\nshe acted within the rules, on the advice. the advice said that every single\u2026 \njournalist:\nfrom the prime minister\u2019s office? \nalan tudge:\nthat every single club where money was allocated was eligible underneath the rules, and she did so in accordance with the rules. as the prime minister has said, there's been the anao report, it has recommendations. we\u2019ll take those recommendations seriously. the prime minister has reiterated that several times and i've given my answer to that question already. journalist:\nshould she keep her job? \nalan tudge:\nyes, of course she should. \njournalist:\nthere's concerns that relief to bushfire victims isn't getting through as quickly as it could or it should. do you have concerns about that? \nalan tudge:\ncertainly, in relation to the payments getting to individuals, they are going through very quickly. and i know from speaking to stuart robert, the responsible minister in relation to that, a person can actually ring up on the phone, they will be answered within 10 seconds typically. they can do the entire application over the phone, and typically within half an hour they will have payments into their bank account.\u00a0 \nnow, we've just announced, also, huge support for small businesses in those areas, of grants of up to $50,000 as well as loans of up to $500,000. now, they will go through the state assessment processes to determine those and there is a formal process, which the state governments are used to doing for those. in addition to that, there is obviously a lot of money, which has been donated by the public very generously, over five $500 million worth, and we obviously want to see those charitable organisations working constructively in cooperation with the state and federal governments as well to get the money out on the ground.\u00a0 \njournalist:\nbut do you have concerns that there are delays in that area? on some areas? \nalan tudge:\ni haven't received such advice. i'm not the responsible minister in relation to that. those charities, many of them, are on the ground right now and working cooperatively with state and federal governments on the ground, doing the best they can. i think there is an enormous goodwill in the broader community. i think there is huge amounts of work, which has been undertaken by state and federal governments. obviously the australian defence force has 6500 people now who have been called up and are working to assist with the recovery efforts, and i think they do provide a great deal of comfort to people. but this is going to be a long journey and i think it'll be a couple of years\u2019 worth of work for these communities to fully recover, just as it was after the black saturday bushfires, which i'm very familiar with because it\u2019s near my patch back home, and it did take a couple of years for full recovery. \njournalist:\nthere\u2019s a lot of private roe 8 signs along the road here. is that something that you think the government needs to take notice of still? \nalan tudge:\nwell, i think everybody knows the federal government's position in relation to that. i think everybody knows the premier's position in relation to that. and today, we're talking about a project which we're jointly working on, which we're jointly funding, and it's one of a number of projects which we\u2019re jointly funding and we just want to get on with it.\n\u00a0 "],

infrastructure to talk about the big $3.8 billion plan to bring forward infrastructure projects across the country by the morrison government. but a lot of it apparently not really being spent until the second half of the next decade. alan tudge, good to see you again. good morning. alan tudge:  good morning virginia, and it's great to be here in the studio. and my first interview, i think, with you in your new role. virginia trioli:  that's right, in this studio. many over the past years on news breakfast. alan tudge:  that's right. virginia trioli:  good to have you here in person for victorians. minister, i'm holding your very own budget papers here in my hand, the 2019 papers. your announcement that you're investing $100 billion over 10 years and you've brought forward now this 3 billion or so into the future or into the present. that three billion- 3.8 billion \u2026 alan tudge:  3.8 virginia trioli:  \u2026 over- the $100 billion over ten years. that's slightly more, then, than 3 per cent of what you're promising to spend, 3 per cent. so are we expected to hold a ticker tape parade for that we? alan tudge:  well, virginia, what we've announced this week across the country, state by state, is bringing forward $3.8 billion worth of infrastructure expenditure \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] so it\u2019s just slightly less than 4 per cent. alan tudge:  \u2026 of which about 1.8 per cent of that, $1.8 billion, will be spent in the next 18 months alone. so we've already got 130 major projects going on right now around the country supporting 85,000 jobs. so there's an enormous amount of infrastructure going on right now. this is bringing forward a further 3.8 billion to get even more projects underway. now that's good for jobs, it's good for commuters and it obviously supports the economy as well. virginia trioli:  totally expected the speech and that's fine. but now we need to get down to the recognition that that is a tiny fraction of a $100 billion spend that your government promised back at the last budget. and indeed a spend that's going to take place over 10 years. it's less than 4 per cent, spread over a huge country that needs an enormous shot in the arm right now. i don't want to say it equates to nothing, but it's pretty disappointing. alan tudge:  oh, i disagree with you virginia. i mean, we\u2019ve- when we came to office, the amount of expenditure on infrastructure was about half of what it is today on an annual basis. so we've already doubled it. even in the last budget, it was a $75 billion program which we increased to $100 billion program. yes, it is over the course of a 10-year period. and that's how we've been doing it in the last few years so that there is certainty. but we've been working closely with the states and territories over the last few months asking them what projects can you bring forward to accelerate because you can't switch projects on necessarily overnight, particularly the big ones. virginia trioli:  but no- but the states have just been going it alone. i mean, particularly \u2026 alan tudge:  [talks over] no, no, that's not true. absolutely not true. virginia trioli:  \u2026 in victoria. but they\u2019ve pushed ahead with their own infrastructure spending in the absence of the big spending that others have wanted to see. alan tudge:  well it\u2019s not- well it's not in the absence of any lack of funding from the federal government. i mean, we've got billions of dollars\u2019 worth of funding here in victoria. i\u2019m a victorian, as you know. virginia trioli:  i do. alan tudge:  i think from memory with we've provided about $26 billion to the victorian government over the course of our term of office. and even in the last budget, an extra $6.2 billion. virginia trioli:  let's get to the victorian spend in just a moment, but i'd like to get you to respond to some of the criticism since this announcement in the last 24 hours. amp capital chief economist shane oliver said that the overall decision was moving in the right direction of course, more money is more money, but the extra cash amounted to just 0.1 per cent of gdp spread over two years and here's his quote: put simply, it's not enough to make a difference to the overall economy which remains a long way from full employment and the reserve bank's own inflation goals. so it's a nice headline figure and i get why you might want to be out here spruiking that, but when it comes down to the reality of a sluggish economy, one that's growing admittedly but so, so slowly, it just amounts to a hill of beans. alan tudge:  well, a couple of points here. first up \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] i mean, is shane oliver right? alan tudge:  \u2026 first up the economy is growing. so we had, the last two quarters, we\u2019ve had \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] i acknowledged that. alan tudge:  and you did acknowledge that. and in fact overnight the oecd lifted our outlook to 2.3 per cent growth over the next 12 months, putting us the fastest growing economy of the g7 and the average growth that they've got for the next 12 months is 1.6 per cent. they've got us at 2.3 per cent. virginia trioli:  i don't know which ocd reports you're reading, alan tudge. this is the one that i read this morning: the australian economy is weak \u2013 and that's the quote \u2013 households are weighed down by slow wages growth and high taxes and they're backing lower interest rates, calls for more government spending and the oecd sharply downgraded expectations for australia while raising serious concerns about the level of debt being carried by households. alan tudge:  [talks over] well they did, and since their september update, they\u2019ve actually increased their outlook for australia. so in their september update, they had us growing at 2 per cent. now they've increased that outlook to 2.3 per cent. our wages now is growing at about 2.3 per cent as well, above inflation. we'd like to see that grow even faster. unemployment is at 5.3 per cent. here in victoria, virginia, and i don't want to baffle people with numbers, but here in victoria we\u2019ve got a 4.7 per cent unemployment rate. so we're not- we're not panicking and the labor party want us to panic and splash money around like they did last time, spend money on dead people and on cats and all sorts of things. virginia trioli:  [talks over] oh, no, no no. alan tudge:  [talks over] we're taking it very methodically \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] let's- let\u2019s- let\u2019s not. alan tudge:  \u2026 virginia, we\u2019ve had our economic plan. we\u2019re laying it out \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] let\u2019s not go to empty rhetoric. alan tudge:  [talks over] well \u2026 virginia trioli:  and we'll actually talk about the calls for you- your government to spend in just a moment, because they have been substantial and there's some significance to that today. but clearly, your read of the oecd figures very, very different this morning. but the key thing with that \u2026 alan tudge:  [talks over] well they\u2019re the facts though virginia. virginia trioli:  \u2026 that- no, i want- i want to take you back to that quote that i put to you there from the economist. is shane oliver wrong? is he wrong when he says that it's just 0.1 per cent of gdp spread over two years, right or wrong? alan tudge:  well virginia, this is one element of our broader economic plan which we took to \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] right or wrong? alan tudge:  \u2026 the election. one element of our broader economic plan. so the infrastructure expenditure which we have underway we're pulling forward even more money. the tax cuts which, as you know, has delivered billions of dollars into the economy. the rba has been dropping interest rates. we've got free trade agreements, more of which we are negotiating. we're kicking off industrial relations reforms. we've got a skills agenda. all of these are part of our economic plan which we've been methodically working through and it's now meant that the forecasters, including the oecd, have us as being the fastest growing economy in the g7, well above the growth rate of the oecd average. virginia trioli:  and- and yet \u2026 alan tudge:  [talks over] there's still headwinds, don't get me wrong. we're not- there's still international headwinds \u2026 virginia trioli:  there\u2019s not- there\u2019s not headwinds, minister, you\u2019ve got \u2026 alan tudge:  [talks over] there\u2019s international- what do you mean, there\u2019s no international headwinds? virginia trioli:  no, the issue is you've got a weak economy. i mean the economy might be growing, but whether it's still strong is open to question, isn\u2019t it? alan tudge:  well, we've always said that these international headwinds- we've known this for a long time. i mean this is why we took our plan to the budget which was specifically designed to support economic growth. virginia trioli:  okay, well let\u2019s get back- let\u2019s get back to those budget figures. alan tudge:  [talks over] [indistinct] the contrast compared to increasing new taxes which the opposition put up. virginia trioli:  let's get back to the budget figures, then, and the projected spending and the promised spending. and you mentioned there the cash splash that you described by the previous government. but let's think about this. i've heard the rhetoric as well from the prime minister about panic and you not wanting to panic. i don't know if this is defined as panic because for what? for close on six, eight months now, you\u2019ve had the reserve bank, you\u2019ve had every business group in the country; some of the biggest employers and firms in the country; you\u2019ve had state governments; you\u2019ve had the international monetary fund for goodness sake. they\u2019ve have all been calling for this stimulus and yet you waited. now it\u2019s been announced 24 hours ago, you finally brought something forward. my question this morning is this for the listeners, what\u2019s being gained by waiting? alan tudge:  well what do you think our tax cuts were? virginia trioli:  you only achieved that by not doing this spending. alan tudge:  what did you think out- but no, what did you think our tax \u2013 we had a massive tax cut package, which we took- virginia trioli:  [interrupts] no. what\u2019s been gained by waiting to spend this money on infrastructure? alan tudge:  [talks over] hang on. virginia trioli:  what\u2019s been gained by that? alan tudge:  [indistinct]. just wait up a sec. virginia trioli:  no, no. don\u2019t move my question onto something i said, minister. alan tudge:  you said for several months\u2019 people have been calling for this. virginia trioli:  for infrastructure spending. alan tudge:  and \u2013 well sorry, you didn\u2019t actually mention that. you sort of said just for stimulus more generally. virginia trioli:  [interrupts] our entire conversation is about infrastructure, minister. alan tudge:  sorry. just previously, as i say, stimulus spending generally. so the tax cuts of course have a stimulus impact, reducing interest rates has that stimulatory impact. and now, we have brought forward this. now, we have been working carefully with the states and territories over the last few months to work out these plans which we have announced this week. virginia, you can't -you can't ring up one day where the state government calls you up and says: oh, can you please deliver three billion dollars and the next day we write the cheque for it. you don't do it like that. virginia trioli:  [interrupts] no. but you can do it over a period of eight months which you didn\u2019t. alan tudge:  no. well we actually have worked very methodically through this. it was back in may when we increased the expenditure on infrastructure from $75 billion to $100 billion \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] and the calls came to release it. alan tudge:  \u2026 and the post-election \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] the calls came from all of these august people to release it. alan tudge:  \u2026 post the election, we\u2019ve been working with the states and territories saying: are there projects which you can accelerate? because not all projects you can accelerate by the way. some of the very large scale projects do take two, three or four years to get going whereas we wanted to identify projects which could get cracking within the next six to 12 months. and that's what we've been methodically working with the state governments on. virginia trioli:  well victoria\u2019s had a number of those and of course a number underway. what i understand is that you've got, or we have victoria i think about $200 million is now coming in for the north east link and seven million dollars for railway car parks. so $207 million in the next twelve months, as i understand it, to victoria, out of this brought forward money. again, not really much you\u2019d chuck a ticker tape parade for, is it? alan tudge:  well so this is money which is specifically being brought forward. virginia trioli:  [talks over] yes. alan tudge:  now, you've got to \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] that\u2019s right. alan tudge:  \u2026 remember in the may \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] that\u2019s not much is it? alan tudge:  \u2026 well in the may budget, we allocated $6.2 billion extra money to victorian infrastructure projects. now, it had the largest share of anybody in the country, about 30 per cent of the share. virginia trioli:  i still don't think we have an answer there to what's actually been gained by hanging on to this infrastructure spending money. alan tudge:  well i don't- i don't accept the premise of your question that we're hanging on to the infrastructure \u2026 virginia trioli:  [talks over] there\u2019s no premise, it\u2019s just a question. well of course you did \u2026 alan tudge:  \u2026 that we\u2019re hanging onto the money. virginia trioli:  it was announced then it hasn't been spent. alan tudge:  but all of these projects, as i said, you can't- you can't just roll out money tomorrow if the projects haven't been scoped and aren\u2019t shovel ready to go. that\u2019s why we \u2026 virginia trioli:  [interrupts] oh i think infrastructure australia has established there\u2019s been plenty around the country ready to go. alan tudge:  no. well hang on, i mean this is why we've been working with the states and territories. if you ultimately do the actual build on the ground, asking them, dealing with them state by state as to what they can do and then matching our money to what their schedules are. so we've been announcing this week and i've been just in western australia a couple of days ago, announcing packages there. what can you bring forward and get cracking next year? not in three years\u2019 time or four years\u2019 time, but next year. virginia trioli:  minister, i've got to move on but i did have just one final question for you and again, it's some another big topic that's been coming up again and again and the prime minister has been addressing. but i don't want to go down to that argument that\u2019s constantly had with the government about climate change and bushfires and when is the right time or not but my question for you is this: why is it so important to your government that there be no link made between australia's emissions, its connection to climate change and a dangerous increase in bushfire risk? what i really want to understand is the intellectual underpinnings of that resistance. why do you resist that connection? alan tudge:  well i don't think anybody has said that climate change is not a factor which may contribute to a higher bushfire risk. but the prime minister was careful to say that climate change is a global thing and we're only 1.3 per cent of emissions. and so had \u2026 virginia trioli:  [interrupts] that's the link - let me jump in and clarify, that's the link that i'm pressing you on. so the link that our emissions, australia's emissions, its connection to climate change and that connection to a dangerous increase in bushfires. why are you so reluctant to make that link? just tell me the why. alan tudge:  well because it's- we've got our emissions policies in place in australia. had we proceeded with labor's carbon tax, it would not have prevented the bushfires which are going on today, virginia, and it is wrong to suggest that had we had a carbon tax in place, we would not have had bushfires in place. virginia trioli:  [interrupts] that\u2019s actually not an answer to my question. alan tudge:  but this is effectively what some of the critics have been suggesting, particularly the greens. they\u2019ve been basically saying that because we didn't have the carbon tax in place, we have bushfires today and that is absolutely wrong. virginia trioli:  why don\u2019t you concentrate on my question which is why you resist that link between emissions and the role that we play? alan tudge:  but i don\u2019t think we have, i mean \u2026 virginia trioli:  [interrupts] well you do. alan tudge:  well i think - and as i just said, i mean it\u2019s a \u2026 virginia trioli:  [interrupts] well the prime minister was very specific in saying \u2026 alan tudge:  [talks over] the climate change \u2013 i mean, people have to \u2026 virginia trioli:  \u2026 in saying that emissions will have no link. alan tudge:  \u2026 understand and people do. i mean everybody understands that climate change is a global thing not a local thing. we've all got to do our share and absolutely australia doing its share in terms of reducing emissions. we\u2019ll be hitting our 2020 targets smashing it; we'll be hitting our 2030 targets and smashing those as well. but this concept that had we had the carbon tax in place or the cprs in place, we wouldn't have the bushfires is frankly offensive to those people who have suffered bushfires in the past. virginia trioli:  i don't think anyone\u2019s saying we wouldn't have bushfires. but the link is real, the link is there and your government resists it. i guess we don't have an answer to that today, you know, maybe another day \u2026 alan tudge:  again, i think we're splitting hairs here, virginia. virginia trioli:  oh no. alan tudge:  the- i think we are \u2026 virginia trioli:  [interrupts] oh no. i think that\u2019s a really crucial point. alan tudge:  i think we're splitting hairs here because \u2026 virginia trioli:  [interrupts] well that\u2019s an interesting revelation if you think that\u2019s splitting hair. alan tudge:  well because the prime minister has said that it is one factor which goes towards the multiple factors as to why there is bushfires going on. but we've had bushfires in this country for as all of human history in this country which is a very, very long time. i mean i remember the ash wednesday bushfires and we had to evacuate from the dandenongs when i was living at the time. i mean that was well before the climate change debate started, virginia, and not to mention that we've got the black saturday bushfires which were catastrophic \u2026 virginia trioli:  [interrupts] and we\u2019ve got some terrible ones to look forward to this summer as well. alan tudge, really good to have you on the program. come back again. alan tudge:  thanks very much, virginia. virginia trioli:

that the state government here in western australia has been so cooperative and so good to work with in making sure that funding hits the ground in terms of projects that will help our economy, help\u00a0 us create more jobs, but also help get western australians get home sooner and safer. alan tudge: thanks very much mathias, premier and minister saffioti. today is a great day for western australia. we are bring for $868 million worth of federal infrastructure dollars into the forward estimates. as mathias was saying, that supports eight projects bringing those forward right across the state, but importantly we are announcing together with the state government, six new projects. now these were projects that were election commitments of ours and have been funded by the urban congestion fund. we have had a great working relationship with the state government. i would particularly like to thank minister saffioti for the working relationship i have with her to make sure that these projects get underway. now the two big ones out of this $200 million which is going towards these six projects are the mitchell freeway widening project, as the premier mentioned. that one is just on $76 million, 50/50 arrangements there. that will save the inbound motorists about eight minutes per day. across the course of the week that means motorists are saving up to forty minutes a week that they can spend with their families rather than been stuck in traffic. the other major one i would mention is the lakelands station. that is a very important railway station which will be built there as well. another good project that has been jointly worked on with the state government. as you probably know that is a very fast growing part of perth and presently along the train line there is a twenty four kilometre gap between mandurah and the next station down the line towards perth. so this will greatly assist residents in that fast growing area. that is an $80 million project which we are contributing the majority of that, but also the state team is making a contribution to that as well. i want to particularly thank andrew hastie for his advocacy for that particular project. but overall, we promised that we would bust congestion and get people home sooner and safer. these six projects certainly contribute to that. rita saffioti: thank you, as minister tudge said this is another great day for wa. more funding for more road projects and railways projects across the state. six new projects targeted at reducing congestion, saving time for families. in particular the mitchell freeway project, hodges to hepburn. it is a congestion point. it is a bottle neck. this is a project we are very keen to get under way next year, partnering with the federal government on a 50/50 basis. so the new southbound widening will save time for families and yet there is another project along our freeways to reduce congestion and make our freeways work better. a number of other projects about improving intersections safety on roads like great eastern highway and great northern highway, the new lakeland transition and also works on wanneroo road and morley drive. so a very welcomed announcement. we are very glad that we have reached an agreement with the federal government to get these projects on our books to get them underway as soon as possible. we also welcome the guaranteed funding of another $860 million over the next four years to make sure we can deliver projects across regional wa. in particular, the bunbury outer ring road, albany ring road and of course in the metropolitan area, the tonkin gap which is a major congestion point for people traveling along tonkin highway but also the starts of a key component of the [inaudible] rail line. so a welcome announcement. we are very keen to have new jobs in western australia over the next two years we will see record amounts of works on our roads, on our rail lines. what we are doing is creating more jobs for western australians through a record construction program. question: [inaudible] \u2026 do you know how long, do you have an idea of how long it will take? rita saffioti: so approximately eighteen months. we hope to get this project underway by the end of next year and we hope to make that sooner. because we are operating with an existing freeway reserve issues on environmental clearances aren\u2019t as great as newer project sites. so we hope to have the project underway by the end of next year but earlier than that we see this together with all the other freeway projects as really changing the way we travel and changing the time we travel on our freeways and really hitting those congestion points. it is true when you are looking across the network some of the key congestion areas like russell [inaudible] road which we are working on now [inaudible] and of course hodges to hepburn is the latest in our congestion combustion program. alan tudge: just on this as well, this project which minister saffioti was just been mentioning will create 500 jobs alone. the six projects which we are jointly announcing today will generate over 1000 jobs. so that is good news for western australians. across the country the projects which we put under construction now, which we are funding are supporting 8500 jobs across the nation.\u00a0 once these get up and running that is 1000 jobs more, so that is great news for everybody. question: senator cormann, do you describe this as stimulus for flagging economy? mathias cormann: we delivered a pro-growth budget in april. we are implementing our pro-growth budget. as we have said all the way through since the election we would do, we work with premiers and chief ministers around australia to explore whether there are opportunities to build some projects sooner if additional funding was brought into the forward estimates. that is what we have done on this occasion. we are executing our plan. we are implementing our plan, which includes $300 billion worth of personal income tax relief, which is coming into the economy as we speak, and an ambitious infrastructure investment program. question: how much of this funding will fall into this financial year? mathias cormann: all of these things will be updated and reported in the half yearly budget update which will be delivered in the middle of december. but this is an additional $868 million worth of funding for western australia, including $817 million worth of bring forwards which are part of $3.8 billion worth of bring forwards nationally. so western australia has been able to secure more than 20 per cent of the accelerated funding for federal infrastructure investments here into wa. question: is this an attempt to stimulate the economy is it a concession that the economy is not doing very well? mathias cormann: the australian economy continues to grow. other economies around the world are shrinking. the world is facing a series of challenges. australia is facing a series of global economic headwinds. there are countries around the world which are facing a series of global economic headwinds. the economies of britain, of germany, of south korea, of sweden, singapore and others were shrinking in the june quarter. the australian economy continued to grow. we are confident that on the back of low interest rates, lower income taxes, continued high investment into infrastructure, our ambitious free trade agenda, our efforts to bring down the price of electricity, our deregulation agenda, our economy will continue to grow. economic growth will gradually strengthen into the future. we continue to implement the plan that we took to the last election. a plan that is sensible and with the cooperation of state and territory governments we will also look at bringing elements of that plan forward if that makes sense. question: this roads projects don\u2019t happen overnight, they are going to take a while to get off the ground. do you need to do something sooner to create more jobs and get the economy moving a bit faster? mathias cormann: the economy continues to grow. we will continue to implement the plan that we took to the last election, which was a pro-growth plan, a plan to build a stronger economy and create more jobs. we have always made the point that investment in high quality infrastructure necessarily takes time. it involves the prioritisation of high quality projects, it involves planning, it involves very careful execution of those projects. that takes time, which is why we are working in an orderly fashion with state and territory governments to explore where we can do more sensibly. alan tudge: can i just add in relation to the projects too though. as minister saffioti knows one of the largest of the projects, the mitchell widening, it will begin early next year. the largest of the ones which we are announcing today will begin late next year, and plus there\u2019s already 85,000 supported by the current projects around the country which we have underway. these other bring forwards, the eight projects which the federal government is bringing the funding forward on, they are all beginning in the next 12 to 24 months. so this is about getting all of these projects going. we jointly want to see them run as quickly as possible and we\u2019re making sure the funding is there to make that happen. question: [inaudible]\u2026\u00a0a major bottleneck for some of these areas in wa with the infrastructure projects are those problems resolvable? rita saffioti: we will continue to have the dialogue, so some projects we are getting very good cooperation and others there have been some other issues raised. so it\u2019s something i am talking to the federal government about. we\u2019re working together to see how we can try to get these projects underway as soon as possible, because we don\u2019t want unnecessary delays. so in bigger projects as i said freeway projects are easier in the sense you are operating within an existing reserve a roads reserves. other projects were we are operating a greenfield site we do have environmental hurdles to get over. we are working with the federal government and hope that the federal government can work to help us in respect to those environment hurdles. question: these projects, the new ones not one of them is in regional wa, and arguably they are the most dangerous roads. is country wa being forgotten here? rita saffioti: absolutely not, i\u2019ll just outline. if you look at some of the biggest projects that are underway, and will be underway over the next 12 to 18 months, between commonwealth and state cooperation, they are in regional wa. look these are projects that have been talked about for decades that it\u2019s taken our governments to get underway. so for example, bunbury outer ring road, that\u2019s a project that\u2019s been talked about for decades and as a result that, will be underway in the next 18 months. albany ring road will be commencing next year. we have karratha tom price road, with stage 3 underway at the moment, and stage 4 now guaranteed as a bring forward. we have other road projects like south coast highway, we have projects on great eastern highway and we have the outback way. it is actually record spending in regional wa. a lot of the projects which the federal government outlined, which were part of the $800 million bring forward, the majority, seven out of eight are regional wa, with the tonkin gap being the only project of those 8 that is metropolitan wa. so regional wa is another big winner. i got to say, this government together with the federal government is spending record amounts in regional wa. we\u2019re fixing those long term issues that no one ever took on. like albany ring road, like bunbury outer ring road, albany ring road and of course the karratha tom price road. mathias cormann: let me just reinforce this. most of the $817 million additional funding over the forward estimates is going to regional projects from albany to bunbury to karratha, you name it. the\u00a0port augusta to perth corridor. the six projects that you mention, the $200 million that\u2019s for an urban congestion fund. that is very specifically designed to deal with congestion in the perth metropolitan area. so those projects are projects in perth. this is all about making sure that people across perth are not stuck in traffic any longer than necessary that we can help people get home sooner and safer. that is the specific purpose of the urban congestion fund. question: what about roads like indian ocean drive or bussel highway where there is only one lane? i know you have started on the widening works, is the federal government going to chip in at all? what is happening there? rita saffioti: indian ocean drive we have again spent money in creating new passing lanes. we\u2019ve got $11 million also being spent over the next 18 months on widening and putting more audible edge lining and doing safety improvements. so i think all up we are spending over $20 dollars as part of the road safety package on indian ocean drive, and we will to work on that. in relation to bussel highway, that\u2019s again a live negotiation with deputy prime minister, michael mccormack in relation to how we can incorporate bussel highway widening works as part of the bunbury outer ring roads. we had feedback, not so positive yet, but we will continue to work with that relationship and try to get those bussel widening works both stages part of bunbury outer ring road. i\u2019ll continue those negotiations. i\u2019m going to melbourne for a transport ministers meeting later this week, and again will be something on the agenda to see if we can get some success in relation on bussel highway. but today is really focusing on the projects that are funded, and there are a lot of projects funded regional and metropolitan wa mark mcgowan: can i just finish with this. i just want to say this is very exciting for the state, this is all good news. this is jobs in the region, jobs in the city, its fixing long term issues that have never been dealt with before. hodges to hepburn, anyone in the northern suburbs will tell you, that is a bottleneck that causes immense grief, and we\u2019re going to fix it. lakelands station, talked about for a long time and it\u2019s in regional wa by the way. it will be something that is much welcomed by the people of southern rockingham and northern mandurah. so long term issues being resolved, creating jobs, fixing a problem that\u2019s what we\u2019re about\u2026 question: can we get the federal ministers on too. this one\u2019s for you minister, i am just going to read it to you. how disappointing is it that financial institutions are letting australians down by not following the laws in place on financial transactions and perhaps aiding in organised crime. mathias cormann: that is very disappointing. every business in australia, like everyone else, must comply with the law. when they don\u2019t, the full force of the law will come down on them. austrac is doing its job ensuring that relevant laws are being complied with. the process now will take its course. question: and then i just have one for minister tudge. this is just from our melbourne office. they are just asking the victorian liberal party has just released its review for the 2018 state election disaster. how much responsibility will you wear for the liberal party\u2019s disastrous result? alan tudge: that review we will look at very closely. but ultimately they\u2019re matters for the party in victoria, the party administration arm to consider that and work out what we do next. we didn\u2019t have the result we wanted in victoria. we wanted a better result. we have certainly got a great leader and a great team to work towards the next election in three years\u2019 time. question: do you have any ideas on what may have gone wrong? alan tudge: that is the purpose of this review, is to properly consider that. where we did well and what we can learn from. we take those things on board as we go into the next election. "], "additional-funding-congestion-busting-m1-exit-upgrades": ["20 November 2019", "the federal liberal and nationals government has put commuter safety and reducing congestion at the forefront of its infrastructure agenda by announcing it will contribute an additional $46.3\u00a0million to upgrade the m1 pacific motorway at exits 41 and 49. prime minister scott morrison said the government had committed $96.3\u00a0million to upgrade both exits under the $4\u00a0billion nationwide urban congestion fund. \u201ctoday\u2019s announcement is another example of this government working to bust congestion and deliver safer roads,\u201d the prime minister said. deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development michael mccormack said the government is committed to bringing forward projects that will have a significant benefit to communities, especially those in regional areas. \u201cthis critical infrastructure will provide job opportunities to local trades throughout construction and when complete will ensure people get to and from their destination sooner and safer,\u201d mr mccormack said. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the government was tackling road network pinch points across south east queensland and beyond under the urban congestion fund. \u201cthis is about busting congestion on key routes like the m1 pacific motorway here in queensland, reducing the time people are spending stuck in traffic and improving road network reliability by addressing local bottlenecks,\u201d mr\u00a0tudge said. queensland minister for transport and main roads mark bailey said the additional funding would cut travel times and make access to and from the m1 safer and easier. \u201cthe exit 41 and exit 49 projects will complement other investments along the m1 pacific motorway including the pacific motorway\u2013gateway motorway merge and between eight mile plains and daisy hill,\u201d mr bailey said. federal member for forde bert van manen said thanks to these critical upgrades, people in his electorate of forde would spend less time in traffic and more time with their families. \u201cexit 41 \u2013 yatala south intersection and exit 49 \u2013 pimpama intersection often experience heavy commuter traffic, and by upgrading these exits we will bust congestion and keep queenslanders moving,\u201d mr van manen said. federal member for fadden stuart robert said the australian government was committed to ensuring the joint investment would deliver on the project\u2019s key objectives. \u201ci am pleased to be able to move ahead on delivering these priority upgrades that are critical to the economic productivity of queensland,\u201d mr\u00a0robert said. the pacific motorway \u2013 gateway motorway merge is under construction and expected to be completed in mid-2020. construction of the eight mile plains to daisy hill upgrade is expected to start in mid-2020. "], "building-jobs-now-and-future": ["19 November 2019", "acknowledgements\u2026 since coming to office a little over six years ago now, the coalition\u2019s government\u2019s primary focus has been on keeping the economy strong. a strong economy is not an end in itself, but is the mechanism for australians to be in jobs, for wealth to be created and for essential services to be funded. on nearly every measure, australia has done well. we are now in our 29th consecutive year of annual economic growth; more than 1.4 million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected; the proportion of working age people on welfare is at its lowest in 30 years; the budget is back in balance for the first time in 11 years; and economic growth is 1.9% - growing faster than all members of the g7, except for the united states. pleasingly, wages growth has continued to outpace inflation, growing at 2.2% over the last 12 months, above the inflation rate of 1.7%. we went to the last election with a plan to keep the economy strong, knowing the international headwinds that we are facing.\u00a0 the plan included: today, i would like to discuss our infrastructure agenda and how that is contributing to this economic plan - both now and into the future.\u00a0 i also want to discuss a related topic, the south east queensland city deal, and how that is designed to also boost productivity and enhance the region\u2019s liveability. infrastructure helps the economy in three ways. it provides jobs and economic activity during the construction phase, it boosts productive capacity through creating faster connections between locations, and it saves people and businesses time. boosting infrastructure has been part of our agenda since we first came to office. in 2014, we proudly announced a $50 billion infrastructure pipeline which was lauded by infrastructure partnerships australia as \u201cthe largest-ever national infrastructure investment program\u201d. in this year\u2019s budget, only five years later, we boosted that to $100 billion. as a government, we have made the tough decisions to commit to projects that had been in the too hard basket for years, with none more significant than the $5.3 billion western sydney airport.\u00a0 this had been talked about for decades, but no government previously properly committed to it.\u00a0 our government did. similarly with other massive projects such as the melbourne airport rail link, where we have convinced the state government to finally build the rail connection that should have been built three decades ago.\u00a0 putting $5 billion on the table tends to have such an impact! this is now in the planning phase and construction will begin in 2022. the inland rail is another monster project that our government is getting underway - a $9.3 billion project that will transform how freight is transported across our continent. here in queensland, the australian government has already committed $10 billion for ongoing works to upgrade the state\u2019s major north-south corridor, the bruce highway. in south australia, we funded the huge north south corridor project which is creating a link across the city that will shape adelaide\u2019s development for decades. we have already committed $4.5 billion to this. in western australia, the city-shaping metronet is underway. every one of these projects is on a monumental scale. every one is a nation building project. when we think of nation building projects in the past, we often think of the great snowy hydro scheme which put in place water and electricity infrastructure and created thousands of jobs. in today\u2019s dollars, the investment in the snowy was\n$8.4 billion. we are building the equivalent of multiple snowy schemes at once with our major projects across the country. over 130 projects funded by the federal coalition government are underway as we speak.\u00a0 the amount of activity being undertaken right now is sometimes lost on the commentariat, perhaps in part because we have been announcing so many new projects over the last 6 to 12 months.\u00a0 it is true, that of the 900 major projects that we have committed to since coming to office, 300 have been announced in the last 6 months. but the activity supported right now by the federal government is unprecedented. our expenditure is $10 billion per year on average over the next ten years, more than double the expenditure in the year before we came to office. across the country, construction of transport infrastructure is expected to reach around $42 billion in 2022-23. this is an infrastructure boom unprecedented in australia\u2019s history. it is also a jobs boom.\u00a0 the 130 major projects funded by our government and under construction today are supporting 85,000 jobs over the projects\u2019 lifetimes. a significant part of this figure is the western sydney airport which alone is 28,000 jobs. jobs that would not eventuate had we not made the decision to get going on the project and allocate the funding. as the 300 other projects announced, but not yet started, move to the construction phase, the jobs figure will escalate further. moreover, the infrastructure underway today supports a bigger economy and ongoing jobs well after the projects have been finished.\u00a0 ernst and young, for example, estimates that over 9,600 permanent jobs will be generated on an ongoing basis as a result of the completion of 80 major federally funded projects it analysed. it also estimated that the economy would be $8.3 billion permanently larger as a result. there is so much infrastructure work underway that there are now capacity constraints in the market.\u00a0 this has been stated by senior figures in both the victorian and new south wales government (where much of the infrastructure is occurring) and echoed by rba governor philip lowe, the australian industry group and others.\u00a0 in august, the head of australian industry group innes willox noted, \"we have an infrastructure boom, but we're having trouble servicing that boom and keeping it going, particularly with people....the stone, quarrying materials, all of that sand is becoming more and more difficult to gather, we're talking more and more about importing those goods.\u201d despite the boom and despite the capacity constraints, the federal government is willing to bring forward funding if projects can be done more quickly.\u00a0 for example, we provided additional funding for the victorian government for stage 2 of the monash freeway. this will enable this critical project to get underway in the first quarter of next year. yesterday, the prime minister and i announced a further $328 million in additional and accelerated funding in south australia, to ensure that we can deliver our infrastructure commitments more quickly. this includes additional funding for key priorities like the darlington upgrade as part of the north south corridor, and accelerated funding for key regional road priorities. as a result of these decisions, an extra $217 million will be spent in the next 18 months. we are in discussions with other jurisdictions, including in queensland, and will be making further announcements imminently. we are also making it more attractive for foreign investors to invest in productivity enhancing infrastructure. the treasurer announced last week guidance on a new tax concession for nationally significant infrastructure projects. \u00a0this new concession will allow foreign investors to access a concessional tax rate of 15 per cent on economic infrastructure projects approved by the treasurer, instead of the 30 per cent that would otherwise apply. this incentive will maintain australia\u2019s competitiveness in a global market where the infrastructure funding gap is estimated to be $15 trillion by 2040. it is not always simple to bring forward the construction schedules of major projects due the time it takes for detailed planning, compulsory land acquisitions, large procurement lead times and complex contract negotiations.\u00a0 as outlined, where state governments can, we will positively consider their proposals. however, this is also one of the reasons we have been focussed on smaller scale projects in our cities and regions.\u00a0 these smaller scale ones, ranging from $200,000 to $50 million, can typically be done by local contractors which don\u2019t face the capacity constraints that some of the larger ones do, and can be implemented within a much shorter timeframe. in the months leading up to the federal election, we announced 166 smaller projects under the $4 billion urban congestion fund. these projects were targeted at urban congestion hotspots. it included 30 projects in queensland, many of them council managed projects, but also some larger state government managed ones, such as new on ramps at exits 41 and 49 of the m1. some of these projects are well known as being desperately needed. for example, the notoriously congested indooroopilly roundabout which disrupts 55,000 motorists every day, or the intersection of newham road and wecker road, which has been ranked by racq as one of the top five worst intersections in queensland. others are less well known, but equally important to local residents to get them home sooner and safer. there is detailed planning, if not work underway, on every single one of the 166 projects.\u00a0 in many cases, people are already employed on the ground undertaking site preparation works and utilities relocations. for example, in western australia, work is underway on the upgrades to the broadway in ellenbrook. in south australia, there are preparatory works underway on the grand junction and hampstead road upgrade and the portrush road and magill road upgrade. there are 12 projects that are out to tender currently.\u00a0 we expect about half of the projects will be under construction next year, with the vast majority of the remaining ones under construction in 2021. this includes nine projects that we will be delivering in conjunction with the brisbane city council. every level of government has an interest in getting these completed as quickly as possible.\u00a0 i would like to turn now to our city deals, which are agreements between federal, state and local governments about the future of our cities.\u00a0 our government has established the use of city deals as a way to deliver place-based policy for our cities. they are providing great opportunities around australia, building stronger, better, and more liveable cities. to date, city deal partners have agreed to over 140 commitments totaling almost\n$5.8 billion in investment by the federal coalition government alone, with further investment by state, local government and third parties. we are progressing a south east queensland city deal, negotiating with the queensland government and ten local councils \u2013 five of which are among the largest in australia. the seq city deal is the most ambitious of its kind to date \u2013 a large geographic region with a range of opportunities to grow many diverse communities from toowoomba out west, to brisbane city, and along the north to the sunshine coast. this will be a 20 year city deal. a deal to transform the region and cater for the rapidly growing population. over the past few months i have been working with the queensland government and the council of mayors (comseq), discussing the city deal with the community through nine roundtables. many of you here in this room today have been part of our roundtables, and i thank you all for your valuable contribution. each city deal highlights different themes or priorities. the ones that are emerging from our seq deal are: the three levels of government will bring these priorities together with a view to finalising the city deal by mid-2020. today, i have sought to convey

alan tudge:  we are, we\u2019re bringing $78 million of new money to south australia and then on top of that we\u2019re bringing forward about $250 million into the next year or two which was previously slated for years three, four and five. david bevan:  okay so this, the bulk of that money, the quarter of a billion dollars, is that\u2019s going to be fast tracked by one to two years? alan tudge:  yeah that\u2019s right, so that\u2019s bringing forward that money into the next couple of years to really get going on a lot of regional projects actually which are ready to go and we can get them up and running quite quickly and that means it\u2019s good for local commuters, but it\u2019s also good for the economy because it means jobs out in those regional areas. david bevan:  can you just give us a couple of examples, which projects will be finished a year or two early as a result of bringing this money forward? alan tudge:  yeah so it\u2019s roads such as upgrades along the port augusta to perth corridor, the victor harbour road duplication, the horrocks highway corridor. all of those areas for example we\u2019ve had money allocated to them but typically for years beyond \u201921-22. and so what we\u2019ve decided to do in partnership with the marshall government is bring forward that money so we can get cracking on those projects immediately. and, as i said, that makes those roads safer, it makes them better for commuters but equally importantly it adds jobs to local economies because you can employ local contractors out in those regional areas and get more people employed. ali clarke:  one of the things, alan tudge, i see on our text line is people who have called for this to happen for a long, long time on the basis of safety more than anything, especially on our regional roads. alan tudge:  yeah. ali clarke:  so why wait until now? why now and not earlier? alan tudge:  we\u2019ve always had a large-scale program of work in the regional areas. i mean, we have a $100 billion program of work across the country so there\u2019s always work going on. but where we\u2019ve got capacity to bring forward projects which have already been designed and ready to go, we do want to bring them forward and we have already done some of that in victoria. we\u2019re now doing some of that in south australia. often it is actually some of those regional projects which are easier to bring forward because you\u2018ve just got local contractors who can do it whereas sometimes, and certainly in the bigger cities, you have some capacity constraints on the larger scale contractors so it\u2019s more difficult to bring forward the larger scale projects. david bevan:  a text from a listener wants to know: the flinders link project, that\u2019s the train line, extends the train line from tonsley up into flinders university and near the medical centre. the listener wants to know: is that a single line? or? alan tudge:  yeah that is about a 650 metre extension which extends from tonsley all the way up to flinders university and the hospital there. david bevan:  but it\u2019s only one line of track? alan tudge:  it\u2019s a single track, about 500 metres of elevated single track. david bevan:  you see, the listener is concerned about that and i can understand why, because you\u2019re building a bridge with just one line, compare it to the original southern expressway which only went in one direction. so wouldn\u2019t it make sense to have two lines which means a bigger bridge? alan tudge:  well, this was the design which was done a few years ago now and it was settled between what was then the weatherill government and ourselves that this would be the case and we were each putting in $62.5 million to make this happen \u2013 so it\u2019s a $125 million project but it is a single track at this stage for that last five or 600 metres. david bevan:  and you don\u2019t anticipate any problems shifting people around when you\u2019ve got just a single line? alan tudge:  well, it\u2019s only that last 600 metres of the single track so it\u2019s still going to be a much better service for students and for people who are wanting to reach the hospital by public transport and that\u2019s due for completion next year. now obviously, we can monitor that over time but i think that\u2019ll make a really big difference to all the students at flinders university and those people who are trying to access the hospital there as well. ali clarke:  alan tudge, with more than $103 million of this money actually going to be having to cover the cost blow outs in a couple of projects and to ensure that deadlines are met, do you ever stop and then turn around and hold the state government accountable for that amount of money that you are going to throw at them? because, let\u2019s face it, if this happens in two or three years\u2019 times you might then be having to throw even more money just because early design or early works weren\u2019t carried out properly. alan tudge:  yeah. we\u2019re always closely examining what the state governments put up to us to ensure that it\u2019s good value for money. we have a very good relationship obviously with the marshall government and we try to work cooperatively with them to get the projects built. now, on two of these projects where we are putting more new money and that is the flinders link project as well as the darlington upgrades, in both of these instances, it was actually scope changes which have increased the price and that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting more money in. at flinders link, for example, the initial scope of the work did not include a train station at tonsley so we\u2019ve decided, following community consultation, to include that train station. now, that\u2019s costing an extra $16 million so the marshall government\u2019s putting in eight and we\u2019re putting in eight and that\u2019ll get that job done. equally with the darlington upgrade, the initial scope of the work didn\u2019t include an underpass at tonsley boulevard so now it is going to be included there and that does cost a lot more money as well and so that\u2019s where an additional $70 million from the commonwealth is going to. ali clarke:  okay. well no doubt we will continue to hear more about this across the morning. thank you very much minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure, alan tudge. alan tudge:  thank you.

great to be back at lot fourteen. i love coming here; i never get tired of coming here. in fact, if i could move my office here, i'd be very, very grateful. today, i'm joined by my friend, alan tudge, federal minister, cabinet minister, who's been a great friend to south australia; sandy verschoor, the lord mayor of south australia; nicolle flint, the federal member for boothby; james stevens, the federal member for sturt; and also di dixon, who\u2019s setting up this important project on behalf of the department of premier and cabinet, on behalf of the people of south australia. today, we're here to officially launch the implementation plan. as i said, i couldn\u2019t be more excited about what is going on in lot fourteen. two years ago, it was a hospital. the previous government wanted to turn it into a housing development. now, what we have is the most exciting urban renewal project in the country. and we've got a chance to create absolutely the biggest and the best precinct innovation ecosystem, not just in australia, not just in the southern hemisphere, but for our entire region. we've got more and more global companies now saying: we love what you are doing here. defence, space, cyber, machine learning, blockchain, agtech, creative industries, all on this site and its major focus is creating jobs for the next generation. so the city deal was a classic example of what can happen when a grownup government can sit down with the federal government, with the local government, and design something in the best interest of the next generation of south australians. and that's what we're delivering here: jobs for the future. i couldn't be more excited. now, my great pleasure to introduce alan tudge. and i've got to say, in introducing him, we couldn't be more delighted with the way that we've been able to interact with the federal government, talk about our aspirations for our state and future industries here, and work cooperatively with you. so thank you very much. welcome back to adelaide. alan tudge: thanks, premier. well, thank you very much, premier, for that very nice welcome to adelaide. and to the mayor and my colleagues behind me, nic and james, welcome. today, we are announcing and launching the implementation plan for the adelaide city deal. and for those who don't know, we just launched this with the prime minister and the premier and the lord mayor in march of this year. today, we outline the implementation plan, and what this does is it details the precise timelines for each of the initiatives over the next decade. as the three levels of government working together cooperatively over the long term to make adelaide more prosperous, to grow its population, and to cement adelaide as one of the cultural and innovation centres of australia. and of course, right here, lot fourteen, is where most of it is all happening. and as is outlined in this document, we have waited for this plan to be signed in order to get on with it. as you can see right here, that there is already so much construction underway. in fact, about $100 million worth of construction contracts have already gone out. about 450 people are already working here. and then, we've already signed the designated area migration agreement as well, which is another element of this implementation plan. over the next 12 months, we're going to see the space agency headquarters open up. the following years, we're going to see mission control. then the year after, we're going to see the discovery centre. so it's all going to be happening over the years ahead. the document itself not only outlines the timelines and the kpis for us, but importantly it outlines the governance structure for the three levels of governments to ensure we stick to the deadlines, to ensure that we maintain our accountability, to ensure that we\u2019re transparent in terms of how we report to the south australian public. i\u2019ve got to say it\u2019s been an absolute pleasure working with the premier, the most exciting, the most dynamic, the most enthusiastic premier in the country in relation to innovation, and certainly, the lord mayor as well, as well my colleagues, nicolle and james, behind us, who have been also instrumental in helping design this implementation plan. and particularly to nicolle flint, for the cultural elements of this implementation plan. that's really exciting as well. so, thank you very much, premier. congratulations in all the work that you are doing, as well as to you, lord mayor. this a great partnership across the three levels of government and i think that is what the people of south australia wants to do. sandy verschoor: thank you. it is actually an absolute pleasure to be here today. this city deal is going to help us accelerate the rollout of additional infrastructure, which is going to change the way the city works. whether it\u2019s smart technology, digital wayfinding or cctv, it\u2019s absolutely going to change the way that we work, and actually make living inner city a better life. and i really thank the premier, his enthusiasm is absolutely [indistinct] and for your support in this deal. this is going to change adelaide forever. and i wish i had a time machine to jump forward just a few years to see everything that\u2019s happened. i know everybody around the country is talking about what\u2019s happening right here in adelaide, and hats off to both of you for the city deal and the premier for your foresight and vision of lot fourteen and i\u2019m very excited that we [indistinct]. alan tudge: well done. do we have any questions on the city deal? question: just how much pressure is on this government to make sure that plans are going to be executed? steven marshall: well, the commonwealth have been very generous with their support, financial support, but they want to make sure that they get bang for their buck and see this site roll out, the city deal done, in accordance with budget, in accordance with the plan. that's why we've done this detailed work, to show them that we are absolutely fair dinkum about delivering. the people of south australia will hold us to account as well. and have a look around us; two years ago it was a functioning hospital. we've worked extraordinarily hard in the 19 months that we\u2019ve been in government to transform this site. later this month we\u2019ll open the australian institute of machine learning, one of the pre-eminent machine learning centres in the world right here at lot fourteen. next month the first people will move into the australian space headquarters, and the smartsat crc. so there is a massive amount of work. we believe by the end of this year, there\u2019ll 900 people working back on this site. now, it's not at the levels it was when it was the royal adelaide hospital. but each month we are increasing the working population on this site, so that we can make sure that we can create a precinct that is going to generate activity here at the east end of adelaide. but most importantly, create new jobs for the next generation of south australians. question: premier, is it hard to keep up your unbridled enthusiasm with our state of unemployment the way it is? the new figures are out in a few hours\u2019 time. steven marshall: yeah, well, can i just say, we have record employment in south australia at the moment. employment has gone up 15,000 people since we came to government. our jobs growth figures are double what it was before we came to government. but there is no doubt there is more work to be done. at each and every day, we apply ourselves to creating more jobs. and lot fourteen is a major part of it. if we looked at the fastest growing sectors in the world at the moment, they are around key sectors like defence, space, cyber, machine learning and all of them have got a place here at lot fourteen. and that means great news for school leavers, university leavers, creating great jobs in south australia. keep them here. and i\u2019m very proud of the fact that since we came to government, we\u2019ve almost halved the net interstate migration out of south australia. almost halved, because we're giving much greater job opportunities for the next generation. now my goal. is to start having a net migration to south australia. i don\u2019t think it's going to be too long until we're talking about a net interstate migration to our state, because of the exciting job opportunities that we\u2019re creating. and lot fourteen is a big part of it. question: premier, we know that the state government is contributing $364m to this project. do you foresee a need to take more taxpayer funds to get the results you need? steven marshall: well, we\u2019ll look at opportunities into the future. we've got seven hectares on this site. we're excited about phase one, which we're implementing as quickly as we can at the moment. but we also believe there is potential opportunity for further expansion down the track. that\u2019s why we\u2019re working hard on the new masterplan overall for the remainder of this site. that's why we're working very hard for the establishment of the aboriginal art and cultures centre on this site. and the international culinary and hospitality management courses that are going on to the site. there's plenty of options for this site, but our principal focus is always on creating more jobs and more opportunities for our next generation. question: just one more question to minister tudge. minister, is the federal government\u2019s contribution here absolutely set in stone when it comes to finances? alan tudge: absolutely, it's documented here. we\u2019ve signed this and agreed on contract. we\u2019ve set up a governance structure to hold us all accountable. and they'll be an annual statement put out which tracks our progress. so this is our seventh city deal document that we have signed, and in every single one we document the governance structure, the implementation steps, and we make public commitments to track the progress against what we've stated. question: premier, can i just ask one quick question? your treasury yesterday explained that it took a swipe at the tourism department [inaudible]\u2026at a cost to taxpayers. do you personally support that campaign [indistinct]? steven marshall: well look, i'm not a commentator on advertising campaigns, but what i will say is i'm interested in results for south australia. i want to see visitation going up. i think there are great opportunities in terms of tourism and increased visitation to south australia. that's why one of our first sector plans was on tourism. we've got a goal to take this sector from $7.6 billion of impact on our economy each year, up to 12.8. we want to do that by 2030, creating 16,000 new jobs. now, advertising the great offers that we have in south australia is part of that. now, we\u2019ve listened to professionals and they\u2019ve assisted with this is campaign which is already having enormous benefit to our state, massive increase in traffic on our digital platforms. let's wait and see how it goes. question: but do you personally like it? steven marshall: look, you know what? i look at some commercials on television which are really annoying, they can often be the most effective and all i'm interested in is the results for south australia. question: it\u2019s not annoying, it\u2019s a depressing [indistinct]. steven marshall: you know, when i grew up there was that palmolive dishwashing ad, you know, imagine [indistinct]. i thought it was the most annoying. it ran for years and years because it was effective. and look, the reality is all we are interested in is results for our state. we've got a great product; what we\u2019ve got to do is get out and sell it. what the professionals are telling us is that the old mate campaign has generated unprecedented levels of interest from interstate. and that's exactly right we want more people from interstate and overseas coming to south australia, spending time here, spending money here because we know if they do that, it creates jobs. question: premier, just on another matter [indistinct] your time here, but yesterday morning [indistinct]. yeah, sorry premier, no, no, obviously yesterday morning we asked you about the fatal crash that happened in the northern suburbs and obviously at that time we didn\u2019t know it was paralympian was involved. have you got a message for his family? steven marshall: well this story has a bit of a personal note for me because i was at school with kieran; he was a great athlete. he represented australia on the world stage. i think every south australian felt enormously proud when he was on the dais time and time again with the gold medals hanging around his neck. he was an outstanding internationally, globally significant paralympian. and also he was just a great bloke. it just brings it home: too many people are thinking that, you know, these road fatalities occurring to somebody else. look, the reality is we've got to take this situation very, very seriously now. these figures that we're now at are completely and utterly unacceptable. every single south australian needs to take care when you're on the road, protect their own lives but to also protect the lives of other road users. question: [inaudible] steven marshall: look, those details will need to be worked through. he was a great south australian; hugely loved. my thoughts are with his family at this very tough time. it is just a tragedy. question: [inaudible] steven marshall: well look, we\u2019re going to just keep working respectfully with the members of the legislative council. i think the package that we have before the parliament at the moment really moves south australia forward. what we put forward is a fairer land tax system with lower rates. most important it's going to drive more investment into south australia. i mean, it beggars belief that the labor party is not supporting this. so now, we work with the crossbenchers but with a top marginal land tax rate of 3.7 per cent paid each and every year, this is driving investment dollars out of south australia. it\u2019s repelling dollars coming into south australia and that's really stifling, massively stifling, investment and job creation in south australia. so for those reasons, we are absolutely keen to do whatever we can to get this legislation through. it will take a massive handbrake off our economy. and i mean again, just to the labor party, to the crossbenchers, we urge people to put the people of south australia first. by rejecting this bill, we\u2019ll essentially be entrenching a very uncompetitive land tax rate for our own state. and that means that we won\u2019t be able to, i think, get the jobs that we need for the future. question: [inaudible] steven marshall: i understand the emotion associated with what happened. people feel very upset about the tragic loss of life. of course, it\u2019s pretty confronting to see the parliament house with that protest out the front, with those hand prints on our historic building. you don\u2019t like to see that but i do understand the emotions going around with this argument at the moment. question: [inaudible] steven marshall: well we're working very hard to make sure that the commonwealth understands that south australia is the home of the collins class submarine. we built the submarines here. we've done the full cycle docking extraordinarily well for the commonwealth. the most important thing for our nation, this is what the defence minister, the prime minister take into account is the availability of our submarine capability. and that's been very well served with the full cycle docking being done here in adelaide. i think we've got the best place to continue to do that. in fact, i think it would be dangerous to move it away from adelaide because this is the place where all of the knowledge about the collins class submarine exist. it doesn't exist in the other jurisdictions. i mean there's no greater repository of collins class knowledge and experience, design, engineering than here in south australia. it\u2019ll be dangerous to move it elsewhere. question: [inaudible] steven marshall: we want to retain every single job here in south australia. if you could imagine splitting the capability, having the design and engineering in adelaide, fabrication 2000 kilometres away, i think this is a dangerous situation. and

"], "transcript-3aw-interview-tom-elliott": ["12 November 2019", "tom elliott:  all right, well, our next guest actually has carriage of this in the federal parliament. he is the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure. alan tudge, good afternoon. alan tudge:  g\u2019day tom. tom elliott:  so why don\u2019t we have a population policy? why don't we have a target of, say, 35 or 40 million people by 2050 and work backwards from that? alan tudge:  well, tom, we do have a population plan and we announced this just a few months ago and in essence, first up we set our objectives. one, we want a population which supports economic growth. two, we want to support the liveability of our cities and the regions that want to grow more quickly. and thirdly, we want to maintain social cohesion. tom elliott:  right. alan tudge:  so we\u2019ve put in place some initiatives to support those ends. tom elliott:  so what's the number then? if you have all these policies and you look at economic growth and liveability and social cohesion, all good aims but at the end of the day, you have to come down with a number. what's the number? where are we headed under this policy? alan tudge:  well at the moment, we are growing at about 1.6 per cent per annum, which has been the long-term average since federation. tom elliott:  yeah, but what's the policy? what's the number? do you want 50 million people or 40? alan tudge:  well, i think australia can be bigger. the question is the pace of growth, how well we manage that growth and critically importantly the distribution of that growth, because dick smith i think only thinks about it from an inner sydney perspective, where absolutely it has heavy congestion there. however, you go out to the regions or you go to adelaide, you go toward darwin or you go toward perth, many of those places want more people and do want to grow more quickly. the real challenge that we've got in australia is that nearly all of our population growth, three quarters of it is in melbourne, sydney and south-east queensland. tom elliott:  sure. but why is it so hard to have a number? i mean, recently you actually did, i think to your credit, cut the total immigration number down to what, 170,000 a year. alan tudge:  160,000. it has been ticking over 190,000, now down to 160,000. tom elliott:  so you have no problem with saying, okay, annual number of visas goes from 190,000 a very precise number down to 170,000 or 160,000. and that will define and it can be calculated, you know, you know the birth rate and the average life expectancy and all those sorts of things. why can't you also have a population target in 20 or 30 years\u2019 time? i just don't understand why it's so difficult. alan tudge:  yeah, so we've actually established a new centre for population inside the federal treasury and that is going to do some of that analysis in terms of better forecasting and how we need to do to sustain that. tom elliott:  but it\u2019s not forecasting. i mean, you can set the target. set the target and then work backwards from that. alan tudge:  well, yes and no, you can do that. well in part what we do want to do is have better forecasting across the country, working with the states and territories to understand what is their carrying capacity, how many people do we want to get to in a certain amount of time, and try to gear our policies towards that end. tom elliott:  when you work that out, though, will you have a target? a hard target? alan tudge:  we won\u2019t necessarily have a precise number for 2100 that australia will get to and then we\u2019ll stop dead, which i think is what you\u2019ve suggested and what dick smith has suggested. tom elliott:  why not? alan tudge:  well you sort of said i think yesterday that we should get to 35 million people and then stop. tom elliott:  stop, shut the gate. alan tudge:  shut the gate, no more babies, no more getting older, no more immigration. tom elliott:  no, no, no, you can have you can have a baby or two. alan tudge:  oh, you are allowed to have a baby? okay. tom elliott:  or two. alan tudge:  or a couple. but whereas what we're saying is that australia can continue to grow. the question is how well we manage that growth and what the distribution of that growth is. the real challenge and this is important, particularly for melburnians and sydneysiders. we've had enormous growth in melbourne and enormous growth into sydney and the infrastructure hasn't kept up with that, frankly. tom elliott:  no, i know but i mean the infrastructure doesn't keep up because you don't know what the answer is. if you started with the first answer, we will have 50 million people by 2060 and work backwards, that would define the annual immigration target, it would define the infrastructure needs in our cities, you might even define some laws about forcing certainly immigrants, telling them where they have to live. but unless you have it's like setting out on we're going to go for a drive but where are we going to go? i don't know. i'll tell you when we get there, you know. why not start with the destination and work backwards? alan tudge:  well, we already do have projections of course and different states and territories have different forecasts as well. tom elliott:  i know, but the annual immigration rate is the defining thing that as a government you can change. now, you can\u2019t tell people how many children they\u2019re to have, unless you\u2019re the people\u2019s republic of china. but you know that australians on average have 1.8 to 1.9 children per woman, and so you can put that in your calculations, you can put in life expectancies and so forth. you can predict, and the only variable is overseas immigration. you issue those permits, they\u2019re called visas. you can decide, is it 100,000 or 70 or 200 or 350 or whatever. but they all come up with different populations at the end of them. why not start with the population you want and work backwards? alan tudge:  well we are actually more starting from the point of view of what we can sustain on a yearly basis, and forecasting forward in terms of what that is likely to mean knowing where the infrastructure is going as well. tom elliott: okay, right now australia\u2019s about 26 point something million. alan tudge:  it\u2019s about 25 million people at the moment. tom elliott:  okay. so if you say 50 million\u2019s the target, most people are going to say: righto, well right now i'm surrounded by x number of people. in the future, i'll be surrounded by twice as many, all right? and people can grasp that. whereas when you define immigration of 100,000 here and 50,000 there, it doesn't mean anything. alan tudge:  yeah, sure. well, in part, we've done that through the australian bureau of statistics which do do projections if you like, of cities and of our country. tom elliott:  so what\u2019s the number? alan tudge:  the last time they did a very long-term projection, they were projecting that australia would get to about 50 million by 2100. tom elliott:  and is that what you want it to be? because dick smith\u2019s saying 100 million by 2100. alan tudge:  well dick smith, i don\u2019t know where he\u2019s got his figure from, because that\u2019s the last time the abs did one and they don\u2019t do such long-term projections now because it\u2019s so far out there, so many variables going on. tom elliott:  but instead of treating it as a forecast, why not treat it as a target? we want to get to no more than 50 million. how many immigrants will be let in? alan tudge:  it\u2019s a little bit horse and cart here. tom elliott:  no it\u2019s not. alan tudge:  because in part, you've got infrastructure which is being built, you\u2019ve got places which want to grow more quickly, and so we do once we actually forecast, based on our policy settings, what the population is likely to be based on our settings in a certain amount of time, and then ensure that the infrastructure is keeping up with that. now we've said at the moment, that a place like melbourne which has been growing very, very quickly over the last decade and i'm from melbourne, i live in the outer suburbs, grew up in the outer suburbs. i know the congestion pressure which people are facing, and that is precisely why we've reduced the immigration rate, as i was talking about before. inside of that 160,000 new cap down from 190,000, we\u2019ve also allocated 25,000 positions for people to go to the regions or the smaller cities. tom elliott:  i know, but sorry, minister, you\u2019re talking about all the little numbers. why not tell us about the big number? why not just have a big picture issue: melbourne, victoria, australia. you have the ability to define those populations via immigration, you do. why not just start with where you want to end up and work backwards? like if you're running a business, you say this is where we want to be. we want to be a company that has, i don\u2019t know, $2 million in sales in five years\u2019 time. how do we get there, right? you\u2019re sort of saying oh, these people keep coming in and we don't quite know what to do.\u00a0 alan tudge:  no, that is not actually true, tom. i mean, it's precisely what i was saying, that we've set up a new centre for population. this is the first time that we\u2019ve had it, the population portfolio to actually then put out more considered forecasts as to where our population is going on the basis of what we think the carrying capacity of the country is. now we've been asking the states and territories who have the primary responsibility for things like water resources and housing approvals and the infrastructure, what is your carrying capacity of your jurisdictions? and then we will try to match the population to fit that, if you like. and that\u2019s why i\u2019m saying it\u2019s a little bit horse and cart. now australia does very well out of having quite a rapid population growth. we've always grown rapidly as a country, and we've done well generally. it's made us wealthier overall as a country and it's made us wealthier per capita as well. and in fact, treasury estimates that about a fifth of our increasing wealth per capita over the last few decades is purely related to population factors. tom elliott:  okay. but again, you\u2019re talking about lots and lots of little things. is there a hard date for when you will assess the carrying capacity of the country based on the population centre and the various estimates? alan tudge:  yes. we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll put out a more detailed population policy in the middle of next year. and following that, there\u2019s going to be an annual population statement. so in essence, we're going to have more detailed forecasts into the future, and then we're going to have an annual statement which will be able to track those forecasts and see whether or not we're on track or not. tom elliott:  but where\u2019s the policy though? let\u2019s say you come up with the carrying capacity of australia is, let's just say for argument\u2019s sake, of 60 million people max.\u00a0  alan tudge:  we\u2019ll make that on the basis of the medium term forecasts as to where we\u2019re going. but i don't think you can say in 2050, we will cap out in australia at 40 million people, we cannot accommodate any more people. tom elliott:  course you can, absolutely you can. alan tudge:  you are saying that we can't have more innovation? you are saying that we can't have many more people in the north of australia? you are saying that adelaide can't grow much more quickly? tom elliott:  i\u2019m saying that the average australian would like a target. alan tudge:  you\u2019re saying that regional australia can\u2019t grow more quickly? tom elliott:  the average australian would like a target. alan tudge:  i think that the average australian who might live in melbourne is absolutely feeling the congestion pressure at the moment and they want a bit of pressure taken off melbourne. we get that. that's what we're doing, by the way, in terms of reducing the migration rate, encouraging more to go to those smaller cities in the regions and massively ramping up infrastructure in cities like melbourne to address that. and then finally putting in place better plans so we don\u2019t get population running in front of infrastructure. tom elliott:  i know, but the best thing to have with the plan is to have your end point at the start. alan tudge:  i know you\u2019re stuck on this, i know you\u2019re stuck on this, tom, but i just don\u2019t agree that you can say in 2050, that we will max out a particular number and that\u2019s it, no more innovation. no more people, full stop, which is your point of view. tom elliott:  alan tudge well, what i\u2019m just saying there will be a certain number of people living here. all right, mr tudge, i know you\u2019ve got to go. i really appreciate your time. and dick smith will be pleased that at least someone in canberra is listening, because he\u2019s spent, would you believe, $60,000 on these advertisements out of his own pocket. alan tudge:  and well he\u2019s got a very binary view of life as well to say. tom elliott:  so do i. alan tudge:  and as do you, to say that if your population grows, you can\u2019t have liveable cities. whereas our view is you can still grow your population, but you\u2019ve got manage that growth, and you\u2019ve got to get a better distribution of that growth across the country. tom elliott:  just out of interest though, if you just had to pluck a number out of the air, is there a number or just in melbourne. i mean, you grew up in melbourne, how big do you want melbourne to be? alan tudge:  oh, tom, stop. i grew up right on the outskirts of melbourne, in pakenham, and i live in knox now, which is my electorate. and i think melbourne can continue to grow, but i think we've really been feeling the pressure recently because the infrastructure, frankly, is probably a decade, if not two decades behind. tom elliott:  no one doubts that. alan tudge, minister for population, cities, and urban infrastructure, thank you so much for your time. alan tudge:  thanks, tom.

"first-look-western-sydney-international-terminal": ["29 October 2019", "australia has been given its first look at western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport with today\u2019s release of the first design images. the design is the next step in western sydney international taking shape, with major earthworks set to commence next year that will lead to the construction of runways, roads, rail and the terminal. the innovative design of the country\u2019s biggest aviation project in decades follows the appointment of the architects who will design the terminal precinct.\u00a0 successful architectural team zaha hadid architects, and australian architects, cox architecture won the honour to design the terminal precinct following a competitive process which generated more than 40 design entrants.\u00a0 the winning design focuses on the customer journey while paying tribute to the western sydney region and natural landscape. it passed a range of value-for-money and technical reviews. prime minister scott morrison said the designs showed the once-in-a-generation infrastructure project coming to life. \u201cthis is set to be the largest gateway to australia and these designs are another step to making it a reality,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cdesigned alongside locals and built by local workers the airport will deliver massive economic benefits to the region.\u201d the appointment of the architectural design team and the first look at the terminal design is a major milestone in the delivery of the federally funded, $5.3 billion western sydney international. finance minister mathias cormann said designing and constructing a terminal capable of catering for 10 million passengers annually was a significant challenge. \u201cto meet the challenge the terminal will be designed for modular expansion, to accommodate the long term capacity of up to 80 million passengers anticipated every year by the early 2060s,\u201d minister cormann said. to be considered for the design project, interested firms were required to have experience designing an airport of similar size and complexity to western sydney international in the past five years. the final decision on the winning design was made by a panel of some of australia\u2019s most renowned architects. liberal senator for western sydney marise payne said the competitive process undertaken for the terminal precinct design led to the very best outcome for western sydney. \u201cthe iconic final design ensures that air travel will be accessible for locals, as well as locking in new opportunities for people who want to work, shop and meet at the terminal precinct,\u201d senator payne said. the airport has committed to delivering 30 per cent of direct job opportunities to western sydney residents and is currently exceeding that target. minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population alan tudge said western sydney would be the big winner as the airport continues to take shape. \u201cthe construction phase alone will support 11,000 direct and indirect jobs in the western sydney region,\u201d minister tudge said. \u201cwithin the first five years of the airport opening it is expected to support 28,000 full time jobs for the people of western sydney.\u201d the design process encouraged the demonstration on how local university students would be included on the design team. member for lindsay melissa mcintosh said designing an airport and working through concepts with local students is important. \u201ci am pleased to see that zaha hadid architects and australian architects cox architecture will work with western sydney university students, local aboriginal groups and other stakeholders to further refine and enhance the concepts to arrive at the final design,\u201d ms mcintosh said. \u201cthis is the first step in preparing our local kids for the jobs of the future by playing such an integral role through the design of the airport. we know that post construction over 28,000 jobs will be created and we want our kids to take those opportunities.\u201d "], "transcript-abc-radio-sydney-interview-robbie-buck-and-wendy-harmer": ["29 October 2019", "robbie buck: it looks like an airport. alan tudge is the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, and he is spruiking this new design this morning. good morning to you, minister. alan tudge: g\u2019day robbie. hi wendy. wendy harmer: hello there, and what do you think of the new design? you love it, i bet. alan tudge:  i think it's pretty special. i didn't choose the design. it was selected by an independent panel consisting of some of australia's top architects. but i think it's a special design and it will be fitting for the brand new western sydney airport, which is under construction as we speak. and we\u2019re unveiling the full terminal design today. as you said, it's got this wavy wooden ceiling, it's got some vertical gardens, it's very open and light. and when it opens in 2026, it will accommodate 10 million passengers right from the get-go. and then will accommodate many more than that. robbie buck: but we're talking 82 million passengers by the 2060s, which is what jfk in new york accommodates. that's a lot of planes. alan tudge:  yeah, that's right. so when it initially opens, it will be about the size of adelaide\u2019s airport today, so catering to about 10 million passengers. so it will be a reasonably busy airport right from the start. it will be a full-service airport. so, discount airlines plus the premium airlines plus international flights going from there from day one, and that will mean a tremendous service for the residents who live out there but it also takes pressure off the sydney airport as well. wendy harmer: i'm a bit surprised in the design that it is so, well, as i mentioned earlier, i think it looks like a country airport. it's surprisingly low rise. i guess airport terminals are. alan tudge:  yeah, i've seen the video of it so far and we'll be unveiling that. it will no doubt be on the news tonight which people can have a look at. and it doesn\u2019t feel low-rise in the video, but let's take a look. i think people will like it and i think it's a very modern design fitting for the area. i mean, the other key feature is it will be the most technically advanced airport in the world when it's built and we probably even expect by 2026, it may not have check-in counters because it may all be automated. you may just be able to walk through and you\u2019ll have face recognition which will tap into your passport to say who you are. so, it could be a really seamless experience as well, and that's what we envision by 2026. robbie buck: how much is it going to cost? alan tudge:  we haven't revealed the figure for the terminal itself. robbie buck: why not? alan tudge:  the overall cost of the airport is $5.3 billion. robbie buck: but just out of interest, why not? minister, why don't we know how much something like this is, which is being paid for, of course, by taxpayers\u2019 money? alan tudge:  so, the entire airport is budgeted at $5.3 billion. that's the money which we're injecting to get it built. now, individual components such as the terminal, we haven't put that out to tender yet and so we don't want to reveal what the overall envelope is for that particular component, otherwise the bidders may in fact [indistinct]. robbie buck: all right, okay. the other issue, of course, about western sydney airport and the terminal looks fantastic, but there is frustration within the area, and we have this from callers whenever we talk about it, about the lack of information around the flight paths. surely we know where the planes are going to be coming in from and going out to, why can't that be released? alan tudge: yeah, we don't know that yet. we put out some initial flight path designs when we did the full business case for the airport, and that was included then. but this is a long and complex process and people will have further opportunities to input into the flight paths. robbie buck: but will they be able to have any effect? i mean, won\u2019t the wind direction? alan tudge:  yeah. even the initial designs which were put out, we did receive that feedback and so a decision was made, for example, that there won\u2019t be a single merge point and that was based\non the community feedback. when the next round of consultations goes out with the next stage of the design, there will be further feedback which comes in as well. but you know, the airport is not opening \u2018til 2026 so we\u2019ve just got to keep that in perspective. we\u2019ve got to do it right. these are immensely complex things to do but we will be taking into account the views of the community and making sure this has the most stringent noise restrictions of any airport in australia. wendy harmer: we are speaking with alan tudge, mp, minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population and federal member for aston. let\u2019s talk about jobs. you are pretty proud of the amount of jobs this is going to bring. tell us more. alan tudge:  absolutely. yeah, so in the construction stage, there\u2019s 11,000 jobs which are being created and then in the operations stage, there\u2019s about 28,000 direct and indirect jobs that will be created as a result of this airport. so it\u2019s a huge, huge jobs multiplier this airport, and we\u2019ve got targets as well to employ local people and already we\u2019re well and truly above that target. so the target is 30 per cent employing local people from western sydney; already we\u2019re above that at about 54 per cent. robbie buck: alright. minister, have you seen the call this morning from the new south wales transport minister andrew constance, who's saying that the federal government should be pouring money towards the new western metro that's been announced by the new south wales state government. they are saying that it is designed to extend to the western sydney airport, but the morrison government is not extending any cash towards it. what is your response? alan tudge:  well, we've already put $33 billion of funds into the new south wales infrastructure program which includes the western sydney airport and rail and roads in western sydney and across sydney and new south wales. we'll consider this in the context of the budget as we do all proposals from state governments but fair enough, minister constance requesting further funds. he wouldn\u2019t be a state minister if he wasn't requesting further funds from the federal government, but we'll consider it in the context of the budget. wendy harmer: we have johnno who has called us and says please make sure that the wi-fi is better than what's at sydney at the moment. alan tudge:  i'm pretty confident it will be, because our ambition is for it to be the most technologically advanced airport in australia. wendy harmer: okay. so are you going to build this airport and then it is going to be sold? is that what is going to happen? alan tudge:  there's no plans for that at the moment. so it is fully government funded in terms of the construction and then governments will make decisions well into the future. robbie buck: and the fact that it's a 24-hour airport i know causes some consternation in western sydney, knowing that say it's going to be a lot of planes landing, taking off all through the night in the middle of the night, we know that it does interrupt people's sleep. what's your message for the people in western sydney? alan tudge:  oh, so that's why we're being really careful about the flight path\u2019s design. that's why the airport has always had no residential areas at either end of the runways at 10 kilometres whereas the sydney airport, there\u2019s residential areas within about five or six hundred metres. that's why it's likely that at night time, most of the flights will go towards the southwest, which is where the less densely populated areas are. so very cognisant of that, but it is important that it is a 24- hour airport as well because almost every other airport in australia, is but obviously kingsford smith isn't and sydney is the international gateway for so many people and it really needs to have an international 24/7 airport. robbie buck: all right. wendy harmer:  well i must say looking at the aerial shots here, it looks like it is in the middle of paddocks that go on for miles and miles and miles. alan tudge: it\u2019s pretty impressive. you should get out there and take a tour. wendy harmer:  all right. it doesn\u2019t seem to be a person within cooee of it. robbie buck: well, we\u2019ll see what happens in five years\u2019 time. alan tudge:  go and have a look out there. we\u2019re literally transforming the landscape as we speak. wendy harmer: all right. robbie buck:  all right, minister. wendy harmer: okay. robbie buck: we better leave it, we\u2019ve got the news. \u00a0thanks very much for your time this morning. good on you. alan tudge:  okay. it\u2019s my pleasure, robbie.

alan tudge:  yeah, well, that\u2019s right. so we announced today the initial designs for the terminal, and it is looking terrific. it\u2019s going to be a really modern, open, light terminal. it\u2019ll be the cutting edge in terms of technologies, it\u2019ll be seamless passenger flow through the terminal, and it\u2019ll be open in 2026, and that\u2019s when airlines will be taking off from western sydney airport, both domestic airlines and international ones. so a really exciting development along the way today. this is a great jobs generator as well, because as we\u2019re building this airport, it\u2019s 11,000 jobs during construction and there\u2019ll be 28,000 jobs being supported during the operational phase of the airport. so, exciting times for western sydney. sharri markson: it\u2019s amazing that this has been under debate and discussion and argument for decades, and then finally there\u2019s an opening date. if your construction runs according to schedule, which nothing ever does, of 2026, which is amazing. tell me, is there going to be enough parking? because that\u2019s the big problem with sydney airport at the moment. you know, it\u2019s the main international airport for australia and people can\u2019t get to it and people can\u2019t get away from it. alan tudge:  yeah, well there\u2019s a couple of issues with the kingsford smith airport. one is that it\u2019s getting to close to capacity, despite the fact that we\u2019re going to have a lot more growth. second is that it\u2019s not a 24-hour airport. as you know, there\u2019s a curfew at the sydney airport presently, and it\u2019s only one of two airports in australia that has a curfew, the other being adelaide. but the third is there\u2019s been car parking constraints. now, all of those issues will be addressed with the western sydney airport when it opens in 2026. it\u2019s on track at the moment, it\u2019s on budget. we fully expect it to open at the end of 2026 with budget airlines, with premium airlines, with international airlines, all taking off in that particular year. and by having that additional airport in sydney as well, it actually does create some competitive pressures too, across two airports. now that puts downward pressure on prices for the airports against the airlines, and that will inevitably flow through to ticket prices as well. sharri markson:  but with your new design that you\u2019ve released today, have you factored in a lot of parking for western sydney? alan tudge:  so, there will be parking for the western sydney airport as well, but by 2026, who knows how people are going to be travelling to the airport. we\u2019re ensuring that there\u2019s going to be a train connection to the airport right from day one. that\u2019s a really important commitment which we have made, and we\u2019ve already got $3.5 billion allocated towards that. but there\u2019s also going to be a freeway connection to the airport as well, and of course people will be able to park there. sharri markson:  it\u2019s actually an interesting point, when you say who knows how people are going to be travelling to the airport. probably not in 2026, but beyond the next decade, you know, well every car company almost is coming out with driverless cars. you as the infrastructure minister, when you plan ahead for cities and give funding for major projects to be built, are you factoring this into your thinking at all, the direction of driverless cars? alan tudge:  yeah, there\u2019s certainly a lot of work going on in relation to driverless vehicles at the transport minister\u2019s forum, and so there\u2019s a lot of thinking in relation to that. but no one really knows how quickly it will evolve. now, i\u2019m actually quite excited by the prospect of driverless vehicles in part, because i think it will help address some of the congestion challenges in our cities. some estimates are that it could reduce the avoidable congestion by up to 25 or 30 per cent, which is an enormous amount. but they\u2019re estimates, we don\u2019t know when it will come in, there\u2019s a lot of regulatory hurdles to overcome, and there\u2019s still a lot of safety standards that need to be overcome as well. but i think it will be inevitable at some stage in the future that we\u2019ll see driverless vehicles. the question is: when? that\u2019s what we don\u2019t know. sharri markson:  are you already working on some of those hurdles? i mean, i find it interesting that it was just raised at a conference. i didn\u2019t know people were already, it was on the agenda at discussions with your state counterparts. alan tudge:  yeah. so there already is through the transport minister\u2019s forum, and there\u2019s a taskforce set up which is looking at these questions. there\u2019s an estimated something like 700 regulations which have to be overcome for driverless vehicle to be able to actually operate in australia. and of course, you want to make sure as well that there\u2019s consistency across jurisdictions, for whatever new rules you might put in place, including what sort of lines or nanoparticles in the [indistinct] that you might be putting in in the future to cater for driverless vehicles. we don\u2019t want to have another rail gauge problem across the states, so that\u2019s another critical component, is ensuring that we have [indistinct] regulations. sharri markson:  now, just on the drought and on drought infrastructure, alan jones has written quite a good piece, a very strong piece, in the telegraph today where he talks about how the australian government built a pipeline from australia to png to carry gas. also as we know we\u2019re funding undersea internet cables to solomon islands in png, but he says that there\u2019s been no adequate water infrastructure built in australia. you as the infrastructure minister, do you think it\u2019s shameful that not enough has been done when australia suffers drought, to help protect farmers when this inevitably will occur? alan tudge:  well i disagree with his assessment. i mean there\u2019s an enormous amount of water infrastructure which is being put in place as we speak, i can\u2019t remember the exact number and i don\u2019t look after that part of the portfolio but we are very serious about this. obviously the states and territories have the primary responsibility for looking after the water [indistinct] by supporting them very strongly as well, and that\u2019s just one element of the overall package in tackling the drought. we\u2019ve obviously got a package which supports individuals who are suffering, particularly through the farmers household allowance which we\u2019ve increased to four years. we\u2019ve got packages which are for communities because broader communities get affected, not just farmers. and of course we\u2019ve also got a fund which deals with the drought and that incorporates things like water infrastructure as well. sharri markson:  what other infrastructure projects do you think should be funded and built right now so that in the future farmers don\u2019t suffer like they are today? alan tudge:  that\u2019s not really in my portfolio, that particular question. i know that\u2019s been worked through by state and territory ministers. sharri markson:  but you\u2019re in cabinet, this is a discussion that cabinet\u2019s looking at and talking about, this is a live issue. alan tudge:  sure but we\u2019ve already got, we\u2019ve got a lot of water infrastructure projects which we are already contributing to, there's been a lot of work being done on the murray-darling basin plan as you probably know, we're providing direct assistance to farmers who are really struggling with the drought and that work is ongoing and there may well be more to come. but, as i\u2019ve said i'll leave i'll leave the details up to the responsible ministers in relation to that. sharri markson:  have you just signed off on extra drought funding at cabinet? alan tudge:  sorry, say that again sharri. sharri markson:  i said have you just signed off on extra drought funding at cabinet? as the government? alan tudge:  well we've been announcing extra drought funding as we've been going along over the last few months as you probably know, so, and that includes the $5 billion future fund effectively knowing that droughts are going to be a common feature in the future as they have been in the past. sharri markson:  look you've got a big population taskforce and review that you've set up. not long ago there were quite strong calls to reduce the population now that the economy is, there are more concerns about the economy and the budget position as well. is this now on the backburner? i mean, any move to reduce the population would threaten our budget position. alan tudge:  well sharri, our position hasn't changed markedly since we first announced our population plan. so the key components are to reduce the permanent migration rate from what was 190,000 to a cap of 160,000 and then within that to allocate a dedicated number of positions, 25,000, specifically for the regional areas. sharri markson:  but is this now such a good idea, to reduce that cap from 190 to 160 when there are concerns about our economy? alan tudge:  well the fundamental issue is that we've got so much growth going into melbourne, sydney and south east queensland that we don't have much growth going to other parts of australia. and so part of our plan is to ease the population pressures off those big capital cities which are really feeling the squeeze. i mean people of sydney, people of melbourne know that because they have been growing so fast and yet there\u2019s other places, other parts of australia such as adelaide, or perth, or some of the regional areas which actually want more people. they're often crying out for skills which they can't get, they've got vacancies which they can't fill. so our plan is really to take some of the population pressures off the big capital cities but also support the aspirations for further growth in those smaller cities in the regional areas. sharri markson:  look, you've announced about 160 odd infrastructure projects to bring forward to help stimulate the economy. how many jobs exactly will these projects create? alan tudge:  well we've got about 130 major projects underway which we are funding and that supports well over 50,000 jobs through those particular projects. so it's an enormous amount of work which is going on, a record amount and we've got a pipeline of work over the next decade as well. now of course on top of that we've got 166 smaller scale projects in the suburbs which we want to get cracking on as soon as possible because they often support the smaller scale contractors in the suburbs of our big cities\u2026 sharri markson:  and how many jobs do you anticipate that will create? alan tudge:  \u2026and don\u2019t put as much pressure on tier one and tier two contractors. so listen, i don't have an estimate for that, we get those estimates as we go through the process with the states and territories because they provide the details for how they\u2019ll actually implement them and how many jobs will be created in the process. sharri markson:  minister just lastly, jeff kennett today said politicians have no vision today unlike when he was premier. what's your vision for australia? alan tudge:  well i know jeff kennett has been saying that ever since he left office. but i mean, we want to see a large prosperous australia where everybody can fulfil their potential, where families can thrive, they can work hard and be rewarded for it, where our environment is clean and where we\u2019ve got every opportunity under the sun for individuals today and for future generations. sharri markson:  thank you very much minister, appreciate your time today. alan tudge:  thanks very much sharri.

"], "transcript-doorstop-perth": ["28 October 2019", "alan tudge:  well, this morning i met with premier mcgowan and minister saffioti, who\u2019s standing right beside me, and we agreed that we would progress the perth city deal, but with a focus on reactivating and revitalising the cbd, so that more people can live, work, and play right in the city centre. now we know that when you look at the population density, the perth cbd is remarkably low, in fact, some of the lowest population densities of any capital city in australia. and we've just had a roundtable discussion as well, of which john carey was participating in that also. and in that roundtable discussion with some key stakeholders from across perth, we outlined some of the ideas which might be able to be utilised to revitalise the perth cbd to bring more people into it, to make it more lively on the weekends and at night, and in doing so make it a more attractive destination for locals, for international tourists, and also to make it safer. and some of those ideas included, for example, moving a university campus or creating a new university campus in the heart of the city, which would bring thousands of students into the cbd, which would then flow into the cafes and restaurants around the area and make the city more lively. there were other ideas put forward about better utilising the river, and better utilising and activating retail precincts and the like. today is just really the beginning of the process, and we\u2019ve agreed that the state and federal governments will cooperate together over the next six to eight months, and work out a master plan for the cbd with the view that we would be signing a city deal come the middle of next year. and that city deal would be a long-term plan to revitalise perth's cbd so that more people can live, work, and play right in the heart of the city. now i\u2019ll just ask rita to say a few words, then john can say a few words. rita saffioti:  as the federal minister outlined, it was a very productive meeting with the premier and also recently with all the stakeholders, identifying some of the key steps that we can take to revitalise the cbd, and really move forward with the whole city of perth debate. so what we've committed to is a city deal in relation to the cbd. as you would be aware, about 18 months ago, there was a memorandum of understanding signed with the previous prime minister. this takes the whole issue forward, and we're very keen to partner with the federal government and also with the city of perth about revitalising the cbd. a lot of discussion and a lot of commentary about the city of perth, but what this will do is set up a plan for the future, to direct government investment and private sector investment over the next decade. what we need to make sure is that we have a plan, and we have a plan that really identifies our cultural precinct, our entertainment and sporting precinct, where we want to attract more people to live, and also concepts of the university and other ideas to actually bring more people to live in the city. we think we can do it relatively quickly, there's been so many reports, so much analysis, but it all centres about bringing more people to live in the cbd, and to make more people, make the city of perth more attractive to more people to visit, and that's both people from within wa, people living in the suburbs, but also interstate and overseas tourists. so we\u2019re very keen to work together. sounds like home. well she\u2019s activating the cbd. actually having more families in the cbd is what we want, so we want her here. more children and more noise and more activity across the whole cbd, and that's what we're very keen to work on. i\u2019ll just ask john to make a couple of comments. john carey: the key issue is is that we're doing everything we can to try to drive more life, vibrancy, and activity in the city. it was actually good today, we had a roundtable with all the major players in perth, and it's fair to say there was a clear agreement that we made one coordinated approach between the state and federal and city of perth. you've got to be clear, we've never had this before. we've had an ad hoc approach to planning for the city, and what this will do will provide a very clear way forward about what will be our cultural arts, sporting precincts, how we will activate the river. so i see this as a really great way forward to driving more life and more people in the city. rita saffioti:  okay. questions, and who to? journalist:  either one of you, i guess. obviously, a city deal with perth has been on the cards for quite some time, it seemed like it stalled for a while. what caused it to stall, and is it back with a bit of momentum again? alan tudge:  yeah, you\u2019re probably right. i mean, as minister saffioti outlined, we signed to a memorandum of understanding, must be 18 months ago now, and it did stall, we didn't get the momentum which we wanted, and so we have reconsidered what what we could achieve, and we've decided that in the short term let's have a square focus on the perth cbd, knowing that it needs to be revitalised, knowing that we need to get more population density there. and then if you have a revitalised cbd, if you have greater population density here, then you\u2019ll get more tourists come here as well, both local and international. you\u2019ll get more international students come here as well, and all of that will stimulate the economy. so that's step one. having negotiated and landed this within the next six to nine months we can then consider whether or not we want to go further. but let's focus our efforts initially on the cbd, achieve something really meaningful for perth both now and into the long term, and then look beyond that. journalist:  so in basic terms, there's federal money on the table to help try to revitalise the cbd? alan tudge:  well, we have to go through a process here. so, city deals are about the three levels of government coming together and outlining a long-term plan, and that's what we want to do here. so yes, but there needs to be some investments, but it's actually more about laying out a master plan over the long term, so that there's real certainty so that people know where we're going, and that certainty means you get private investment as well. and that's what we also want to see. journalist:  hobart had about $783 million for its city deal, darwin $200 million. is there any kind of value you can put on a deal like this? alan tudge:  listen, we have to we have to work through the process, we\u2019ll do the proper consultations with the stakeholders. as john carey pointed out, there's a lot of good pieces of work which have already been done, which we will need to go and have a look at. and then we'll outline what the plan is, both in the short term, the medium term, and the long term. journalist:  how much are you willing to spend on perth, perhaps? alan tudge:  well, we've already spent over $13 billion on infrastructure since coming to office, and obviously we\u2019ve fixed up the gst situation, but we\u2019ll continue to be investing in perth, but we're not at that stage yet. journalist:  any discussions around light rail or light rail systems in the cbd for transport options as part of this deal? rita saffioti:  well, transport we considered as part of the master plan. so we\u2019ll be looking at issues to do with pedestrian and cycling access, and that\u2019s some work that's already underway in government. and of course, identifying the corridor, so that's the key part of the master plan. we\u2019re happy to make decisions in respect to infrastructure spending for identifying the corridor, because you need to future proof that corridor and also facilitate land use around that corridor. so in relation to cbd, they\u2019ve been part of the discussion. and just picking up on a point in relation to the original city deal proposal that was signed, much of that is already underway anyway, because at the time it was very much a metronet city deal, and that infrastructure has been allocated, and a lot of the planning reform and station development that was part of that city deal are underway anyway. so what this does, this allows us to concentrate on the cbd and on the city of perth and try and activate it as quickly as possible. journalist:  what ideas would you like to see come to fruition? rita saffioti:  well, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about a university campus, and i think we all acknowledge that having a university campus in the cbd would really create an enormous amount of activation, and will draw young people to the city. and as we\u2019ve said, i do go shopping on the weekends. there is activity but it\u2019s really at night time you know, it\u2019s really making sure that people have things to do at night, and there's a lot of activity at night. and a university campus, if you look around the world but also around australia, have been, i think, the key instigator. more population of course, and other services around the area too. so some of the issues that were raised was that if you want to bring more people into the city centre, it's about what services need to be provided. schools and other amenities are things that have been raised. and i think that we can look at that over the next six to eight months, because you want more people in the cbd, but you also actually want a mix of demographics. so, you want families, you want younger people, and you want people that want to go out and enjoy what the city can offer them. journalist:  if we're talking about having a deal signed in six to eight months, how soon after that would we say money starts to flow? rita saffioti:  well, it just depends. first of all, the time frame of what's deliverable. so i mean, all these things are longer term. and so, as the federal minister outlined, this is really about having a plan that can guide government and private sector investment. as we've said, we've seen a lot of investment in different parts of the city of perth in the past. but what we want to do is actually link them together and actually guide further government investment. so, i think the old idea of just build one thing and that's going to change the city isn\u2019t the right way; it's actually having a plan, identifying key precincts, and make sure we attract people to the city to live, to visit, and also a mission like the university campus and other sort of schools and tafes are also things that we would like to consider. journalist:  what can state and federal government really do in terms of a university campus? there already seems to be a bit of interest from ecu, murdoch, uwa coming in? rita saffioti:  i'll start off, and maybe the federal minister wants to come too. but one of the things we're looking at is all the unutilised government-owned land across the city of perth. so, the state government has land parcels throughout the city of perth. and what we're looking at and we'll take a stock take of those parts of land which we believe are underutilised and can possibly form part of a future city deal. so we believe, as a state government, one of our key levers, two key levers, land and also planning and facilitating higher density as well. so we think those levers in particular are things we're really interested in. and so, identify areas of land that are currently ready for development or those that are underused by state government agencies now that can be put on the table as part of any further investment by universities and federal government. alan tudge:  i'd just say that we've already signed seven city deals around australia and we have several underway as we speak. in many of those city deals, a university has been at the heart of it. when i think about the darwin city deal, for example, it's creating a new campus in the cbd of darwin and became one of the centrepieces of that deal. and that was the same actually in the launceston city deal, and in other city deals as well. so it was certainly a common theme in the stakeholder group today, but it was just one of the themes. and other themes were how do we activate the arts precincts, for example, because that can be a real mechanism to get people into the city where you\u2019ve got more activity at night, and by having more activity at night and having more people around, it actually makes the place safer as well. and there's all sorts of other ideas. we want to work methodically through these in a cooperative fashion over the next few months, and then negotiate putting together an agreement which will be over the long term. some things will inevitably be funded in the short term, others being medium, some will be in the longer term. journalist:  will this plan also look at maybe addressing, because if it's a long-term plan, also look at addressing the homeless issue in the cbd, as that could deter, i guess, tourists coming to the city as well. john carey: well, look, i just want to be clear we\u2019ve already started rolling out a new homelessness plan for the city, as you'd be aware, very soon an accreditation system with dedicated precincts will be coming into perth. the state will be also introducing its 10-year strategy, which will have initiatives there. so we do see that the approach to homelessness, which we are taking seriously, because it is such a critical issue, has its own separate approach. journalist:  is it still the most appropriate place to have all those services? john carey: well, no one is saying that any business should suck it up. i mean, that's why we've got to try a new approach to homelessness in our city. the simple reality is it's very clear that the work of more than 50 groups in the city, while admirable, hasn't been working to best effect. that's why we're bringing in a new coordinated approach with the accreditation system, with dedicated service precincts. those precincts are aimed to be away from residents, away from businesses and retailers, because we understand that whenever you are dealing and tackling with homeless issues, there are going to be complexities and also potentially anti-social behaviour. so that should be announced by the end of the year. that will be dedicated service precinct areas where we engage and deal with homeless issues. journalist:  just on the universities again, is it a bit of a battle between the universities, do you think it's going to be more of having different, i suppose, presences from several universities, or do we need to just have one big presence, one big campus, and they\u2019re going to have to fight for it? alan tudge:  we haven\u2019t got to that stage yet. so it was simply one of the ideas which has come up in the roundtable discussion today, and it's also been an idea which has come up in other reports, but we\u2019re nowhere near making decisions upon that. journalist:  what do you think is going to be the most important part of this deal, is it going to be congestion? you talked about congestion, is it one of those ones where perhaps the federal government is relied on most for the sort of funding that will be required to deal with that around the cbd? rita saffioti:  i actually think it\u2019s probably getting the right plan, and getting more people living in the city. i think that's probably the most important objective. in relation to congestion, we're spending records amount on rail infrastructure and road infrastructure, identifying key areas across the suburbs. but when it comes to the city, it\u2019s really making sure we have enough people in the city at night on weekends to make sure we have a more active and vibrant city. journalist:  and how are you going to convince people to live in the cbd? rita saffioti:  well, i think the whole issue is about the amenity and also the services. and so we identified that, if you have a family who want to live in the city, some of the challenges in relation to access to primary schools and so forth, so i think they\u2019re the issues that we need to address. and make sure that we have all the amenity on the suburbs in the cbd context to really help us allow people who want the cbd lifestyle, to have some of these services, and some of the access to some of the key services that you'd have in the suburbs. journalist:  so you\u2019re going to start investigating primary, high schools, within the cbd? rita saffioti:  well, we did investigate, we have a new high school, the bob hawke college. journalist:  it\u2019s not quite central though. rita saffioti:  it\u2019s very accessible, very accessible to the inner city. but issues of primary schools have always been raised, and an issue that's been raised for a long time in relation to i remember the east perth development, a key issue at place at the time was where did the children go to school. i think that's a real issue and something that we need to address. like i said, it's also making sure about future proofing too, and making sure that where we identify surplus land, that we can identify it for key infrastructure in the future, whether it be a transit corridor, whether it be a [indistinct] or whether it be other services. if we have a plan, what we'll do is like i said, guide government investment and private sector investment and the federal government investment into the future. journalist:  how much do you think this deal should be worth? rita saffioti:  no, no. we\u2019re working very cooperatively to get a good outcome for the city, and so it all depends on the priorities and the timeframe of expenditure, but we really support this idea and we think it\u2019s a good idea to move the whole debate about the future of perth forward.

"], "6pr-mornings-interview-gareth-parker": ["28 October 2019", "gareth parker: the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure is alan tudge. he is here for a range of things, including meetings with his state counterparts. minister, good morning. alan tudge: good morning, gareth. gareth parker: thanks for your time. so the announcement came on saturday that western australia, or perth to be more specific, would actually now be added to the list of regional parts of australia for migration purposes. what does this mean? alan tudge: yeah, that's right. so this is a good development for western australia, and perth in particular, because what it will enable is for more international students to come here in particular but also for businesses to access a broader list of occupations for which they'll be able to sponsor people into the country. now that overall will mean stronger population growth in perth, with stronger population growth, you are likely to get house price increases and stronger economic growth.  gareth parker: i did make the point earlier before the break that the first thing mark mcgowan did when he was premier was write to malcolm turnbull and ask for perth to be taken off the regional list. alan tudge: well, that was a decision of the premier then, and i\u2019m not going to criticise him now for changing his position. perth has had pretty weak population growth for several years now, and that impacts the overall strength of the economy and house prices, that means that perth is missing out on some of the opportunities which the eastern cities have. the eastern cities at the moment are going gangbusters in terms of population growth. particularly my hometown of melbourne, it's been growing by about 2.5 per cent per annum and that means it has huge economic vibrancy to it. now, with some respects, melbourne's really feeling the pressure from that population growth, whereas perth is almost the opposite, it hasn't had that growth, hasn't had the opportunities, and therefore this change that we're making now will support perth's aspirations. and i think it just means stronger population growth for the city, and therefore better business growth, more international students, more vibrancy and the like. gareth parker: right, i\u2019d like to test that with our listeners. are you on board with strong population growth or stronger population growth in western australia, and in perth in particular? 922 11 882. i'm glad that you acknowledge some of the downsides there, minister. i mean, anyone who\u2019s been to melbourne in recent years knows that it has changed a hell of a lot. traffic's dreadful, house prices are through the roof. alan tudge: absolutely. i mean, that is my hometown and we\u2019re really feeling the congestion pressures in melbourne. gareth parker: so why do we want that here? alan tudge: well, you\u2019ve had about 1.1 per cent population growth into perth, averaging about 1 per cent per annum, where the national average is 1.6 and there\u2019s advantages to population growth. if you don\u2019t have the infrastructure keeping up with that, then there can be significant disadvantages. but certainly from an international students\u2019 perspective for example, you bring international students into perth and they bring money, they bring their families to move and to visit, and that means they\u2019re going for the tourism activities, going to the restaurants, et cetera. so there's real benefits from international students. but as well, businesses that can\u2019t find workers, they're able to sponsor people in to fill those skills gaps, and that means overall the economy grows more strongly. you get more jobs, more opportunities for young people, and that's what a strong population growth does provide as well. gareth parker: say businesses can't find workers, yet unemployment in western australia's higher than the national average at the moment. alan tudge: well a business is only able to sponsor a person into the country if they are unable to find an australian to do the job first, but nothing changes in relation to that. and we\u2019re about to strengthen those rules so that people have to demonstrate that they have advertised multiple places and illustrate they can\u2019t find an aussie. but then if they can\u2019t find an australian and that the position is on the jobs skills shortage list, then they can fund for somebody to come into the country to fill those roles. gareth parker: but surely we'd be better off training our own? alan tudge: absolutely. gareth parker: i mean we've got higher unemployment than the national average. there's new data out this morning that says that the number of apprentices has fallen 30 per cent in five years. there's a disconnect here, there's a gap. i'm sort of trying to make these dots connect and i can't quite do it. alan tudge: absolutely, we\u2019re going to be training better our own, and we\u2019re going through a whole exercise with the prime minister to completely revamp the training system so that people are better trained into the positions that are available, so we're looking into that. but i agree, you always want to provide the opportunity to an australian that\u2019s willing, capable, and has the skills to be able to do so. but where there isn\u2019t an australian to do that job, then you do want to give the business the opportunity as well to sponsor somebody in to fill the shortage. otherwise, that business doesn't grow as quickly as it could, and that impacts overall on the wealth of the city and of the country. gareth parker: okay. there\u2019s a big push. a lot of economists, commentators are calling for more to be done by the federal government in terms of stimulus. and the treasurer josh frydenberg and indeed the prime minister and the finance minister also pretty set on delivering the surplus. but is there recognition that we need to get on with some of these big projects to get the employment happening? alan tudge: yeah, i mean we are. in states across the country, we\u2019ve got 130 major projects underway as we speak, employing and supporting over 50,000 people into work. that's happening as we speak, and there\u2019s another 160 in the planning now. and we\u2019re speaking with each of the state governments and saying: if you've got projects that can be brought forward, then let us know because we will be able to consider bringing funding forward to be able to get those projects going. so, they\u2019re conversations which i know the prime minister has been having and i\u2019ve been having across the country too. but, you know, there\u2019s an infrastructure boom across the country actually, in addition, we've cut the income taxes and that means money flowing into people's pockets as soon as they put in a tax return of which tens of thousands of people already have. for most people, that's an extra thousand bucks they'll get back to be able to get additional stimulus into the economy as well. gareth parker: with these changes to the migration system, how much extra growth would you expect this to add to the wa economy? i mean, has anyone modelled it or are we just throwing darts? alan tudge: it is very difficult to estimate that. what it does is provide the opportunity for an expanded skill shortage list to be able to access. but the most important change and i emphasise this, is on international students. now, international students, believe it or not, has been one of the major parts of population growth across the country, yet the international student numbers have actually been in decline in perth. so, by being considered a smaller city or regional location, it means you get additional incentives for international students to come to perth rather than go to one of the other destinations on the east coast. that additional incentive is an extra year\u2019s work rights. now, that means that they're likely to get far more international students and that supports the population growth. but importantly as well, it brings money into the country directly and brings their family members often over here to visit perth as well, and that's also stimulating the economy and adding to business growth, et cetera. gareth parker: 922 11 882. are you on board with this agenda to increase the rate of population growth in wa? give me a call. minister, we\u2019ll just ask you about a couple of other quick ones. there's a new poll out today in the australian that says that people think that owners of electric vehicles should contribute to the cost of road infrastructure in the same way that people who drive petrol and diesel vehicles do. as everyone knows to our great chagrin, we pay petrol excise every time we fill up our tanks. you\u2019re going to have a looming problem here, aren't you? as electric vehicles take off over the next 15 years, there's going to be a huge gap if we don't do something to change the system. alan tudge: well, i think that is something that we'll have to look at because you're right when you go to the petrol pump, you're paying a fair bit of that petrol price is in tax and that goes towards the infrastructure. but if you're using an electric vehicle, you don't pay that price. so, at the moment, only a very small percentage of people are actually driving electric vehicles it tends to be wealthier people and many people, many stakeholder groups are now saying that there should really be a road user charge for people driving an electric vehicle. i think that is something that we will have to look at down the track but it's not on our agenda right now. gareth parker: how far down the track? because you\u2019ve got to get it quicker than later i would\u2019ve thought. alan tudge: it\u2019s just as i said, at the moment it\u2019s only a very, very small percentage of the overall vehicles that are electric vehicles. so it\u2019s not a considerable issue right now. what some stakeholder groups are forecasting is that, well, it may be a higher proportion down the track and that means less fuel excise to be able to invest in the infrastructure is the argument they are making. and also just from a fairness perspective, if you're driving a petrol car, you're paying a tax whenever you fill up. you know, should the same tax be applied to electric vehicle users if they're using the same roads is the argument to be made. gareth parker: so would you charge people as they travel per kilometre rather than get rid of fuel excise altogether and charge every vehicle whether it's petrol, diesel or electric, wind power, i don\u2019t care? but charge them all to drive x cents a kilometre? alan tudge: well, the argument, which people like the automotive associations, are saying is that there should be a per kilometre charge for electric vehicle users. that's their argument, in effect to match what the price is that a petrol car, an owner of a petrol car would pay. that's what they're saying, almost from an equity perspective as much as maintaining the tax revenues which is invested back into the road infrastructure. now as i\u2019ve said, that's not in our plans at the moment, but i think it will be something at some stage that will have to be examined. gareth parker: and last of all, your west australian colleague, senator dean smith, thinks that the gst should be either broadened or the rate increased to 12.5 per cent to get rid of payroll tax. good idea? alan tudge: no. it\u2019s not on our agenda, not in our plans. we don\u2019t have a mandate. we\u2019re not going to be doing it. gareth parker: not a good idea? alan tudge: not a good idea. gareth parker: why not? alan tudge: well, we just have no proposals at all to increase the rate of gst and we\u2019re not going to be increasing the rate of gst. [inaudible] changing our [inaudible] we had a government unless we had a mandate from the people and we don't have that mandate. gareth parker: you'd love to get rid of payroll tax though, wouldn\u2019t you? alan tudge: oh, i'd love to see payroll tax lower but that\u2019s a state tax. but it is up to the state governments around australia to do that. we look after income tax, the corporate tax. we collect the gst revenue. of course, all of that gst revenue actually goes back to the state governments and as you know, we did a big deal for western australia just last year to ensure that you get your fair share here in perth and in wa. gareth parker: all right. minister, thank you for your time this morning. alan tudge: good stuff, gareth. thanks very much. gareth parker: good on you. alan tudge, minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure.

October 2019", "tom connell: joining me now here in the studio is alan tudge, minister for population, cities, and urban infrastructure, thanks for your time. alan tudge: g\u2019day tom. tom connell: now, we\u2019ve got agreements today. we always like it when people are getting along and helping out the nation. what are we talking about here, a new approach to population. what\u2019s the detail that we can gleam from this? because you\u2019ve been talking about this approach for a while. alan tudge: yeah well that\u2019s right, this is the first time that the states and territories, with the federal government, have agreed on a population planning framework, so in essence, for us to align each of our respective responsibilities much more closely. because when you think about it tom, we have the major population growth lever falling in our responsibilities. that's the migration rate, which comprises 60 per cent of the population growth. but the states and territories have the primary responsibility for the infrastructure delivery, for the housing approvals, for the services and the like. and you need to make sure those things are absolutely in sync because if they're not in sync, you have your population for example running ahead of infrastructure, and then you have congestion or you don't have the houses approved and you get house price spikes. that\u2019s what today is all about, and that's why we've got a framework. tom connell: so you go around to all the states and, for example, if you talk to victoria, they go here's where we want melbourne to be, here's where we see victoria. you feed all of this in, and then that actually contributes to the overall net migration rate? that\u2019s how this works? alan tudge: yeah. that's basically what that is saying, traditionally the federal government has largely set the population rate ourselves with some input from the states and territories, but now we want to have much greater input from them, in terms of what is your desired population growth in your city and your state; can we align our levers to achieve that. and what do you need to have in terms of infrastructure and housing approvals and services to be able to meet that population growth. furthermore, you've got to look at the demographics too because that's critically important in terms of economic success; in terms of the ageing of the population, the skills there. tom connell: very hard to control. alan tudge: yes and no, again migration becomes so important in that regard. we do really well in australia because we bring in largely skilled migrants who are young, an average age of about 26, and that keeps our working age population high so that we\u2019re not ageing so rapidly, and therefore more are people working, being productive; to support those people into retirement. tom connell: so you're getting more data and you want it to be more accurate, because it has been very inaccurate in the past. how does that feed into the overall population, i mean, are you going through a process where you'll have a population you want to hit in 2030, 2040, 2050, and do you control for that or let growth sort of control where the population goes? alan tudge: we are in terms of that second question, certainly much more strongly leaning in terms of where we want to see growth than we ever have. now, traditionally again migration being the major population growth lever, it constitutes 60 per cent of our population growth. traditionally we've just let people come and settle wherever they like. now we've actually created incentives for new migrants to go to some of the smaller cities in the regions, which are desperate for more people but can't get them. tom connell: and that\u2019s the where, the overall, i mean, at the end of this process will you have a figure for 2030, 2040, 2050? alan tudge: we haven\u2019t got to that yet. tom connell: but is that what you want to achieve? alan tudge: we have agreed through the process today that we will have a rolling three yearly plan, which will update every three years, we\u2019ll update a population plan. and we'll do that in collaboration with the states, and then we'll have a yearly statement as well which will in essence track ourselves against that plan. now, we haven't worked out the details of that in terms of how far in advance we\u2019ll forecast and want to say, well, we ideally do want to see x million people here and x thousand there. tom connell: but is that a possibility? alan tudge: that\u2019s where we\u2019re leaning towards, i\u2019m saying, tom. tom connell: and do you have a broad? alan tudge: which is much more of a settlement strategy. tom connell: yeah, yeah. but do you have an idea right now for where you might land, how far ahead- could we, in a year, possibly have 2030, here's where the population we want to get to, here's the number? alan tudge: well, we will certainly have better forecasts in relation to that based on our policy settings at the moment. and traditionally, tom, on that, we've largely relied on, say, abs, and you referred to how we're out in the past, or the treasurer might have referred to that earlier today. tom connell: well, yeah. basically from 2002 to now, you thought it\u2019d be two and a half million bigger. it got to five million. alan tudge: it got to five million. and in part, those were projections rather than forecasts. what i mean by that is that it tended to look backwards as to how we've been going and just assumed that it would be going forwards, whereas we want to get to a position and today was about this, to say we actually need much more sophisticated forecasts of our population region by region, city by city. tom connell: and so, if you have that forecast, a better one for 2030, is that a target you try really hard to hit and not go over? or is that simply trying to get a better estimate? you know would you pull on levers and go: we\u2019re going to be two million over, we don't want to be over? alan tudge: if you're doing a forecast, it'll be based on what our policy settings are, and then we want to track ourselves against those forecasts so that the councils and the state governments, who have the primary responsibility for the infrastructure and housing approvals, can have greater surety as well that, okay, this is what the population is much more likely to be coming, and we can plan accordingly rather than be planning for x and then all of a sudden, having a lot more people. tom connell: and one of the big levers you can pull is net migration, permanent migration. you wouldn't be afraid to go: we\u2019re going quite a bit over here. we are pulling migration right back? alan tudge: well, we haven't got to that point yet. we have said that we're going to pull the migration rate down and we're implementing that from 1 july of this year and we\u2019ve said over the next four years, we will cap that permanent migration rate at that lower number, at 160,000 per annum, whereas it was at 190,000 per annum. then, within that cap of 160, we've got 23,000 dedicated spots for the regions and the smaller cities. tom connell: can i ask you as well, temporary migration, because this can have a much bigger impact and oscillate very quickly, 700,000 i think in the country at the moment. is there anything you can do to control that? alan tudge: well, it's a good point that you make. our population is made up of obviously australian citizens, and then you have new migrants who come in here as permanent residents and then you have temporary migrants. sometimes they can be kiwis, they might be international students, they\u2019re long-term holiday makers and the like. tom connell: but the same impact on resources. alan tudge: but they can have the same impact on resources and they tend to be more demand-driven programs, particularly, say, what used to be called the 457 visa which provides short-term people to fill skills gaps. tom connell: specialist, yeah. alan tudge: specialist skills gaps. now, we have said, and we've put in place already, incentives particularly for international students, to go to some of the regional areas and the smaller cities because they're the biggest components of short-term migration. tom connell: right. but that still has that same net impact. would you look to reduce that overall or is that something that would hurt the economy so you wouldn\u2019t look to reduce that? alan tudge: the permanent migration rate in the medium term is actually what drives the overall migration rate. tom connell: so, is it bouncing around? alan tudge: it\u2019s the year to year, it bounces a bit because of the temporary. but the permanent migration rate actually does establish the medium-term growth. tom connell: but you wouldn't want to temper that rate at all? alan tudge: well, the permanent migration rate, we have tempered, we have pulled down. now, we've announced that for the next four years. let's get to the next stage where we do announce\u2026 tom connell: nothing yet on temporary? alan tudge: well again, for temporary, we've put in place incentives for the international students. tom connell: i wanted to ask you finally about rail. so the andrews government is considering this cheaper airport rail link that will rely on existing tracks out to sunshine. if they were going to go down this path, would the federal government still commit $5 billion towards it? alan tudge: well, we want to see a fair dinkum, high-quality service from melbourne cbd to the airport. that's why we\u2019ve put $5 billion dollars on the table and we're working cooperatively with the states to see that vision implemented. now, there's a lot of complexity associated with this project so we\u2019re just methodically working through it. a good rail network which is affordable and is at appropriate speeds that people can get there. it's competitive with the other options. tom connell: so the question is, because i know there's a lot to these types of infrastructure, but at the same time, using that track out to sunshine is seen as failing some of the measures you just mentioned there: being affordable for consumers, being fast as well. would that be a deal breaker for your government? alan tudge: well, we haven't got to that yet, tom. i mean, we're in the negotiations in relation to this and i'm having good faith negotiations with the victorian government on it. we think it is almost certainly that we'll need to have dedicated tunnel from basically from the cbd to sunshine, which then becomes a really important node for fast rail to be able to shoot from as well. tom connell: rather than existing tracks? alan tudge: rather than existing track, and then to have upgraded track out to the airport. we think that\u2019s most likely outcome. tom connell: right. if that was the option the andrews government wanted, you\u2019d have a problem with that? alan tudge: well, we haven't got to that stage yet, tom. i'm just saying that's our initial view was that\u2026 tom connell: but the andrews government seems to be considering it. alan tudge: and that that becomes important as well for our vision for fast rail out to geelong\u2026 tom connell: yeah. exactly. alan tudge: \u2026where we've got $2 billion on the table. tom connell: yeah. alan tudge: it relies upon having that fast connection out to sunshine. tom connell: alright. we'll see where it goes, alan tudge. thanks for your time. alan

[utopia excerpt] jon faine:  i have your press release here, a plan in place for geelong city deal rollout, miniter. this is straight out of utopia. alan tudge: jon, it\u2019s your final week. i'd thought you'd be a bit less cynical in your final week. jon faine:  sceptical, not cynical. alan tudge: no, this is actually a really good plan that we've developed in consultation with the state government and local councils down there. jon faine: is that on the talking points? alan tudge: what's that? jon faine:  this is a really good plan we\u2019ve developed with the state government, local council, to revitalise geelong. alan tudge: alright, let me at least give you a few key facts in relation to this. jon faine:  yeah, and the substance please, not the spin. alan tudge: and there\u2019s substance, jon, and it's your final week. so listen, this plan is $370 million of new money going towards revitalizing the tourism economy from geelong down the great ocean road. jon faine:  to be spent on what? alan tudge: so, it's to be spent on a number of things. now, the major point, though, is that outside of melbourne, the great ocean road down there is the most popular tourist attraction in victoria. jon faine:  one of the most popular in australia, more people go to it than the great barrier reef and uluru combined. alan tudge: absolutely, that\u2019s right. about six million people go down there. but two-thirds of them literally just drive down there and back again. and the tourism infrastructure down there, in some respects, is a bit tired, as you probably know, particularly down towards the twelve apostles. so this money starts at the twelve apostles actually, a brand new visitor centre there. there's going to be a new seating area, where you can sort of sit and have your lunch under cover. jon faine: there\u2019s one that was just built, it was finished about a year ago. alan tudge: new steps down to the- jon faine:  [talks over] at the apostles. it\u2019s just been built, new toilets, facilities, caf\u00e9, it was only finished a year ago. alan tudge: this is a whole new precinct down there with a new visitor centre. it's going to be upgrading the old homestead nearby. there's going to be new steps at the gibson down to beach and it will actually go through the cliffs, so you walk down through the cliff down to the beach. it's going to be terrific new development down there, so that people hopefully go down there and stay. we're also putting in place electricity and sewerage and other things so that other businesses may be able to start up. jon faine:  what, so people don\u2019t go to the toilet in the bushes anymore. alan tudge: well there\u2019s obviously that, it is a lot more than that, jon, in terms of upgrading the twelve apostles precinct which anybody who's been down there recently would probably acknowledge is pretty tired. but then from there there's also money going into other parts of the shipwreck coast and then all the way to geelong where there will be a new convention centre built in geelong. jon faine:  well there's not a new convention centre being built, there's planning for a convention centre. alan tudge: well there\u2019s money set aside for the actual construction as well, so the planning is the first piece of the puzzle. and then there\u2019s money set aside for the construction. jon faine:  when? alan tudge: oh well the planning will take, say, 12 months and then the construction will be the two or three years thereafter. jon faine:  ten years it says in your press release. alan tudge: well, we want to get on with it as quickly as possible, so our money is there. the state government is the major funder of the convention centre. but we want to get cracking on it. jon faine:  so why is senator sarah henderson, the former member who failed at the last election to be the member for corangamite, why is she on your press release instead of the actual sitting members who happen to be from your political opponent\u2019s party, the labor party? alan tudge: well this is a three levels of government who have agreed to this, and sarah henderson is a member of the government. jon faine:  but the local member? alan tudge: and she is our senatorial representative in that part of victoria. jon faine: she\u2019s not the senator for geelong and the ocean road. she\u2019s the senator for victoria. alan tudge: she\u2019s the senator for victoria. jon faine:  so- but if you are in fact partnering with the state government and the local member\u2019s not even been given a look in, isn't that just you playing party politics with a major announcement? alan tudge: no, not at all. i mean, i can see you've got the press release there in front of you. you've got three levels of government there at the top of the press release. we\u2019ll be making the formal announcement down in geelong today. jon faine:  but you've added on sarah henderson who lost the seat of corangamite. alan tudge: well, she\u2019s a senator now, so she's a senator from victoria. she still lives down that way. she represents the area. for us, that is a very typical way the governments operate jon. jon faine:  alright. and just finally are you concerned about donald trump's plans for withdrawing us troops that have been between the turks and the kurds, which it's widely expected will lead to, well, possibly a massacre on worst case scenario of kurds. you yourself were personally involved previously in bringing people from that troubled area and finding them sanctuary here in australia. alan tudge: i mean, this is a decision of the united states, not ours. and president trump has been making the point that he'd be withdrawing troops for some time i think since he's been elected. we're, look we're obviously in close consultations with united states and our other allies in the region. we have some concerns for some of the australians who are still in the region and marise payne, the foreign minister, is obviously dealing with that as we speak. jon faine: should we be bringing those women and children home? alan tudge: just let me finish on the previous point. i mean, she has said in her statements overnight that she's just calling on everybody just to de-escalate and just be calm in relation to the response here. president trump has issued some statements in relation to turkey. jon faine:  i don\u2019t so much want a potted summary of where the geopolitics is, i'm more interested in what you, alan tudge, think we should do about australian citizens who are trapped in this. alan tudge: there's about 64 largely women and children who are trapped in one of the camps there. jon faine:  should we bring them home? alan tudge: we're not rushing to repatriate those people. jon faine:  so we've brought the yazidis in because they're christians, but we won't help these people because they\u2019re muslim? alan tudge: no, it\u2019s nothing to do with that. it's to do with there\u2019s 64, these were typically the wives and children of some of the isis fighters. some of them aren't australian citizens at the moment. they may be eligible for australian citizenship by virtue of having been married to one of the isis fighters who was australian. jon faine:  should we be bringing them back? alan tudge: there may be some security risks associated with some of them as well, so we just need to tread carefully in relation to this and this is exactly what the foreign minister is doing. jon faine:  thank you for your time this morning. it's always been fun to engage in the contest of ideas. alan tudge: well thank you jon. it's been a pleasure having these discussions with you over the last, oh, a great many years over a lot of topics. jon faine:  i don't think you believe that, but you\u2019re saying it anyway. alan tudge: well some of them have been fun, some of them less so, jon, but congratulations to you on an outstanding career and you've made an absolutely terrific contribution to melbourne so well done. jon faine:  that\u2019s kind of you and thank you. alan tudge, federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population and no, it's not true that he's the role model for utopia. "], "doorstop-geelong": ["08 October 2019", "journalist: so, a fairly historic day today, alan, the signing of this deal? alan tudge: it's a really important day for geelong and the whole shipwreck coast because we're outlining a 10-year vision to really activate the tourism economy and that means more people down here, more jobs, more wealth for local people. journalist: you mentioned tourism too. that tourism spend's quite small, isn't it? seventeen cents, i think, at the moment. alan tudge: yeah. it's ridiculously small and this is the real issue, is that so many people come down to this beautiful part of australia, but they literally do day trips there and back. and what this plan is about is building better infrastructure so that people are more likely to come and spend money, stay the night and really get to know the region. and through that, you're creating jobs in the process. journalist: how do you balance increased tourism and preserving those natural assets people take for granted? alan tudge: you've always got to balance that correctly. but there's still so many opportunities down here and things like even additional walking tracks, which are funded in here, might open it up to a whole new different set of tourists to be able to explore that particular area. i'm really excited about the investment down at the twelve apostles because it's an iconic part of australia and yet there's really so little infrastructure down there at the moment. so people literally do go down there, take a look at the twelve apostles and then drive back [inaudible]. plus importantly and i mentioned this before, $23\u00a0million, in essence for the underlying infrastructure, which then enables new businesses to set up down there. so ideally actually we might have a hotel down there or other restaurants or caf\u00e9s, so you can really make it an experience over a period of days, potentially. journalist: jaclyn, you said earlier before this is above politics, it's an enduring document and everyone is going to be held accountable. how is that going to work exactly? you're going to be accountable to each other or to somebody else? jaclyn symes: well, i think the public. i think this geelong deal is about the geelong community and those along the great ocean road. so, the money is on the table. we've got pretty good public servants that are delivering it. there's an implementation committee. i think the media are pretty across the plan. i reckon there's a few people to hold us to account and we've got an implementation plan which says when and how we're going to deliver it. journalist: everyone here will be well aware that the long and sometimes tortuous process it is to get to this point, you would hope that it doesn't descend to finger pointing if certain projects aren't delivered by these deadlines? jaclyn symes: i'm feeling really optimistic about the delivery of the projects. i think they've been well thought out, they're well structured. there's the implementation plan to say how to get along with it and i think we're actually quite excited about delivering them. i don't think there'll be finger pointing, i think there'll be celebration when we reach each milestone. journalist: sarah, it must be nice to be back to see this come to reality given you had a little bit to do with making it happen in the first place. sarah henderson: james, it is great to be back and it's wonderful. this is a very exciting day for geelong and the great ocean road and the broader region. as you know, i've been advocating for the city deal for a very long time and it was a great day when that was announced, led by the commonwealth government, our government of course, and it's now fantastic to see the three levels of the government working together and driving an enormous amount of investment into our region, $370\u00a0million and not just into geelong city but also right across the region, including down our magnificent great ocean road. so, it is a very exciting day. journalist: yeah. nothing that hasn't quite made the final plan that you'd like to see in it? alan tudge: sarah has always got a long list. sarah henderson: t here's always more to do. no. look, james, as you know, we worked very hard to make sure that some really important projects in lorne, in skenes creek, in apollo bay were included in the city deal, so i was very pleased to drive that initiative to make sure that all of the great ocean road economy was included in the city deal. and so now i think we've got not just an incredible investment in the twelve apostles as a destination but also investments along the great ocean road which will encourage tourists and visitors to stop, to spend more money, to stay overnight, and to experience the wonders of our region. journalist: just on the fast train, alan, the last time you were here, you announced $2\u00a0billion dollars for the fast train. how are those talks going with state government? alan tudge: they're progressing. we obviously want to see these built as quickly as possible and we've got $2\u00a0billion on the table to see it happen, and that would mean a 32-minute journey from geelong station to southern cross. and that would completely transform this region in the process, building that connectivity. now i'm in discussions, in good constructive discussions with the state government at the moment. the project does interact with the melbourne airport rail link project in terms of the initial first bit from southern cross to sunshine and that's the most complex and expensive bit. and so we're working through that, but i'm hoping that we'll have full commitments from the state government in the near future. journalist: and you're still saying $4\u00a0billion will do it, what you have to do? alan tudge: let me be clear about this, it's actually a $10\u00a0billion project. $6\u00a0billion is from southern cross station to sunshine, but that's been covered by the melbourne airport rail link money where we've got $10\u00a0billion set aside. and then you've got an additional $4\u00a0billion expenditure from sunshine in geelong of which we're putting in 50 per cent. and then we're asking obviously the state government to come up with the other 50 per cent. so as i said, we're working through it. the state government's got the business case underway, that's a $50\u00a0million business case. but we really just want to get cracking. journalist: i might get a statement from jaclyn on that if i can, on the fast train? jaclyn smith: sure. well i think in terms of regional rail, the andrews labor government has demonstrated its bona fides when it comes to investing in regional rail and trains and making passengers' journeys more comfortable, quicker and more efficient. and i think jacinta allan, the minister for transport infrastructure and major projects, is very committed to making sure that we're at the table having those conversations. and as the federal minister has indicated, the reports out of those conversations have been very positive. journalist: what's the state view on that? obviously the funding, is it enough money to get this done, finished? jaclyn smith: i'll leave the matters of costing projects to the relevant minister. but as i've said, she's at the table, she's having productive conversations and i think our record speaks for itself when we talk about the investment that we make in public transport in the state of victoria. journalist: okay great. thank you. alan tudge: i'll just add to just your answer jaclyn, with holding everybody accountable as well. this is the seventh deal which we have signed nationally. and so far the implementation plans are very effective in terms of outlining precisely what each level of government's responsibilities are to deliver upon. and furthermore we'll outline at a yearly public update against each of these commitments as well. so that's another mechanism of accountability back to the australian public in terms of ensuring that we're delivering upon them. journalist: okay because questions will obviously be asked if in 10 years' time if everything's not done. alan tudge: it's going to be very, very clear because i mean as you see when you walk through the documents, i mean some of them have very precise timelines attached to them. i've just opened up here apollo bay harbor. you know, q1 2020 is the consultation; q3 project plan agreed; q1 2021 commencement of the design; commencement of construction q1 2022. so we hold ourselves accountable. we meet at the leadership level frequently in terms of myself, jaclyn, the mayor of geelong or other mayors of other shires. and that's outlined in the document as well in terms of the governance structures. and then there is an officials level committee as well which oversees it and elevates any issue which they're concerned about falling behind to the respective minister to make sure it stays on track. sarah henderson: and the other thing that's important to point out is that if those milestones can be brought forward, there's the ability to bring the funding forward and to bring the projects forward. so if the various proponents are able to do that, then there is the ability to bring those projects forward as well which is very important. journalist: just on your population hat, alan, is there a danger geelong's growing too fast at the moment in terms of its growth rate? alan tudge: it certainly has been growing quickly. and i can understand why because it's such a beautiful part of australia and there's job opportunities down here, you can have an amazing lifestyle. i know some people will decide to commute into melbourne each day. as you probably know, the largest driver of our population growth is the migration rate, that constitutes 60 per cent of the nation's population growth and we've brought that migration rate down from a cap of 190,000 down to a cap of 160,000. and then within that we've actually allocated dedicated positions just for some of the smaller cities in the regional areas. so we think that will take a bit of pressure, population pressure off melbourne, sydney and places like geelong. journalist: okay great. alan tudge: thank you. \u00a0 "], "plan-place-geelong-city-deal-rollout": ["08 October 2019", "a clear path toward economic diversification, tourism growth and a thriving city centre has been laid out today with the launch of the geelong city deal implementation plan. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the city deal would inject $370 million into geelong and the broader great ocean road region. \u201cearlier this year, we outlined our promises to rebuild the tourism infrastructure in this iconic part of the world; today, we commit to the implementation plan to make it happen. more tourists means more jobs,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cthis is government working at its best when the three levels come together to agree a long-term master plan.\u201d victorian minister for regional development jaclyn symes said all three levels of government were committed to achieving a shared vision for geelong over the next 10 years through the city deal. \u201cplanning can now begin on a new 1,000-seat waterfront convention and exhibition centre, set to enhance geelong\u2019s position as a premier city, with a revised business case and an agreed project plan due by mid-2020,\u201d ms symes said. \u201crevitalisation of central geelong and the city\u2019s waterfront under the city deal will improve access, support tourism and enhance community activities and major events.\u201d senator for victoria sarah henderson said she was pleased to see a clear path forward for priority infrastructure projects in the greater geelong region. \u201cthis is a beautiful part of australia and projects under the city deal recognise the need for world-class tourism infrastructure to ensure geelong and its surrounds remain one of the nation\u2019s most iconic tourist destinations well into the future,\u201d senator henderson said. \u201cafter fighting so hard to secure a city deal including for major projects like the upgrade of apollo bay harbour, point grey lorne and the development of a world class coastal walk, i am delighted that we have reached this next stage in delivering these vital projects for our region.\u201d mayor of greater geelong bruce harwood said with sound plans in place, a number of important infrastructure initatives can become a reality. \u201cthis is an exciting time for the greater geelong region with projects under the deal set to create employment opportunities for our growing community and attract more tourists to our clever and creative region,\u201d cr harwood said \u201cwith a finalised implementation plan in place, we can now move forward with key projects designed to further revitalise our cbd and waterfront, grow our visitor economy and ensure the diverse natural beauty of the region can be enjoyed by everyone well into the future.\u201d initiatives under the city deal include investment in the geelong convention and exhibition centre precinct, revitalisation of central geelong and the city\u2019s waterfront, delivery of priority tourism infrastructure projects along the great ocean road and shipwreck coast, the redevelopment of the queenscliff ferry terminal, expansion of deakin university\u2019s geelong future economy precinct, and a commitment to support indigenous, local and social employment and procurement opportunities.

"], "launch-australian-governments-centre-population": ["04 October 2019", "today, i am launching the new centre for population, to be based inside of treasury. this centre was in the may budget with funding starting in july of this year.\u00a0 it will soon be at full capacity of about 20 staff. the centre will become the primary location for all population related matters inside the australian government and will work closely with the states and territories, academics and think tanks in order to share data, research, ideas and expertise on population. australia has a fast growing population - more than double the oecd average - which has supported our economic growth but in recent years has put pressure on our big capital cities. the centre will provide data and policy analysis to support the following broader objectives: in the immediate term, it will focus on particular tasks to support these objectives, including integrating data, better forecasting, greater transparency and initial research. i discuss these further below. australia has done well from our population settings over the decades. our population growth, and the migration settings that support it, have been key drivers of our economic growth, both in absolute terms and on a per capita basis.\u00a0 it has made a significant impact on our workforce participation rate as well as our productivity. treasury has estimated that a sixth of our per capita wealth over the last 40 years has been due to population factors. it has also made our cities larger, more vibrant and diverse, and supported opportunities for younger people that previously weren\u2019t always present. but this growth has put pressure on the liveability of our cities, especially when infrastructure, housing approvals and services have not kept pace. this has been the case over the last decade or two in sydney and melbourne, and to a lesser extent in south east queensland. these three locations constitute 75 percent of the entire nation\u2019s population growth.\u00a0 in recent years, we have also experienced regional areas that have struggled to find the workers for the available jobs. the leaders of smaller cities, such as adelaide\u2019s, darwin\u2019s and perth\u2019s have aspirations for faster population growth. last year the prime minister established a new population portfolio inside of treasury with the aim of addressing some of these challenges while supporting our economic growth.\u00a0 we outlined an initial population plan which reduced our migration rate, encouraged more growth in the regions and smaller cities and boosted congestion busting infrastructure. \u00a0importantly, it foreshadowed working more closely with the states and territories to integrate the differing responsibilities that each level of government has.\u00a0 coag agreed to establish a population planning framework which is being considered by treasurers in october and leaders in december. the centre, however, becomes the critical component to all of this on an ongoing basis.\u00a0 in supporting the broader objectives, the centre will be focused initially on four tasks. first, on integrating and sharing population data from across the commonwealth and, should the states agree at coag later this year, from within their jurisdictions as well. even within the australian government, there are data sets from at least 8 different agencies that are not adequately coordinated and integrated. this includes bringing together data from the abs, the treasury (used to inform the budget and the intergenerational reports), department of home affairs, department of education (in terms of student populations and policy), the department of health and the australian institute of health and welfare (population projections for states and territories to inform aged care policy), the department of social services (for social security and housing support planning), and department of infrastructure (for transport and other related forecasts). second, it will undertake better forecasting and annually track actual data against the forecasts. population projections and forecasts have often been inaccurate and not aligned. this has made it more difficult for local and state governments to plan accordingly. for example, the abs projected melbourne would grow by 500,000 people between 2004 and 2018. actual growth was almost three times that at 1.3 million. federal, state, territory and local governments use differing assumptions for population projections, sometimes relying on different data sets between them which adds complexity. at the local level, projections are typically provided by state and territory governments using abs data, however many local governments also compile their own projections. within one state jurisdiction, it was reported to me that that the aggregate of each of the sub-regional forecasts was 12 percent different to the state wide forecast. the centre is tasked with improving the reliability of forecasts.this will include taking over responsibility of forecasting net overseas migration. this now means that all components of population growth forecasts and projections for the budget will be in one location. as well as forecasting, it will track the actual data against the forecasts. this will ensure governments are better equipped to make informed recommendations about a range of matters, including for the allocation of government resources. the third task will be to create greater transparency over population data to support better planning. the centre\u2019s work will culminate each year in an annual national population statment, the first of which will be released in 2020. developed in partnership with states and territories, the statement will be an overarching document capturing the population landscape in our country including composition, distribution, and broader demographic trends. this will include population data against other key inputs such as housing approvals. it will assist all levels of government and our community better understand how our populations are changing from the national level through to our smaller regional towns. it will also look at the way our population estimates from previous years have compared to actual growth, to improve future estimates. bringing all of this together for the first time, the statement will be the basis for analysing how our population is changing and how to continue to best address these changes. a new website has also been established to provide a single home for the centre\u2019s work and the government\u2019s population analysis and research. this will be a repository for key information and will ensure the community has ready access to the latest population insights. the centre is also working closely with the australian bureau of statistics and with the academic community to identify ways to improve the visibility of population data even further. the fourth task of the centre will be to undertake key pieces of research.\u00a0 it will focus immediately on two items: population drivers and population distribution. each state, territory, city and town has its own population story. the centre will look carefully at the drivers of population growth in australia and how they differ across the country. this is fundamental to understanding what our future population will look like. for example, net overseas migration has been the dominant factor in melbourne\u2019s recent population growth, while net internal migration plays a larger role than overseas migration in regional victoria. similarly in sydney, where nearly all the population growth has been from net overseas migration, while net interstate migration is negative. it is imperative these differences are analysed and understood. the centre will look at the composition of population growth across australia and explain the elements and underlying factors which drive this growth. building this strong evidence base will inform better population projections which will in turn help all levels of government and the community with planning and policy development. related to this will be research to better understand the distribution of our population and the role policy can play \u2013 factors which influence where people choose to live, both now and into the future. it will develop insights into why people choose to settle where they do, when and why some people choose to move and how policy impacts those decisions. by executing on the tasks and research priorities outlined, the centre for population will support the government\u2019s population plan and help us to better plan for australia\u2019s future. "], "sky-news-live-interview-laura-jayes": ["04 October 2019", "laura jayes: and on that note, let's go to alan tudge now. he's the minister responsible, he'll be making the announcement later today. alan tudge, thank you for your time. what is wrong with the data you have at the moment? what information don't you have available to you? what resources don't you have to make these decisions? alan tudge: g'day, laura. in essence, what the centre for population will do is aggregate a lot of the different data sets that we already have. now, we have about eight different data sets within the commonwealth government which aren't integrated at the moment. so the first step is going to be to integrate that data. and then ideally we integrate the state governments' data as well that concerns population. second, we do want to have better forecasting capability. typically, at the moment, we've actually done more projections rather than forecasts, and what i mean by that is that you tend to look backwards as to what's occurred, and then model that going forwards, rather than actually forecasting precisely what might likely occur based on your policy settings going forward. and then i think thirdly laura, it's about having greater transparency for everybody to see, so that we can then integrate our population forecasts, what's occurring around australia, with the infrastructure, with the housing approvals, with the services et cetera. laura jayes: what's the end game here? is it less overseas migration or just more managed? alan tudge: no, in some respects, there's a few objectives here. the most important objective still is to support our growing economy, and population is a very important driver to that. not just in terms of overall gdp, but gdp per capita i.e. our population settings make a difference in terms of how individually wealthy we are. but secondly, we do want to ensure that our cities maintain their liveability. and previously over the last couple of decades, we've had tremendous growth in our big capital cities but very little growth in some of the smaller cities and the regional areas. so our objective is to take a little bit of the heat out of the big capitals and support the growth of those other areas, particularly the regional areas actually, which are struggling to find workers. and then the third objective really, laura, is to ensure that australia maintains its harmony and stays together. so those three things have to come together in our overall population plan. we've already outlined the initial steps of that, but there's obviously more work to be done. laura jayes: just this week, we saw the skills shortage data for the last financial year as well. there's now 39 skills on that list, that's three more than the year before. how are you putting that data into this research and collaborating that? alan tudge: so that a key thing which is done and updated every six to 12 months in terms of what the skills shortage lists are, and that determines whether or not a business can sponsor somebody into the country. but we've certainly been leaning more aggressively in, and i know that pete sort of raises this, how do you manage population? in some respects, we've linked in much more heavily already over the last six months on this by, a) actually reducing the migration rate down by about 15 per cent on a permanent migration. second though, we've created a lot more incentives for new migrants to come into the country, to go to some of the smaller cities and the regional areas. this includes international students, which are a very big part of the of the incoming people coming into the country. but as well as for permanent migrants to go to some of those other areas, because the default position typically is that most people come into melbourne and sydney, and to a lesser extent brisbane. those three locations have 75 per cent of our overall population growth right now, whereas ideally we'd have a slightly better distribution of that growth. laura jayes: as we just mentioned immigration is intrinsically linked to the growth of our economy. is part of your remit here to, i guess, decouple that into the future, albeit slowly? because it was scott morrison as treasurer who said a cut in the migration intake, i think the suggestion from tony abbott at the time was around 90,000 as an annual cap. that would cost our economy about $3\u00a0billion. alan tudge: well, population is a critical component to our economic growth. i mean there's three big levers to economic growth. they're the three p's as people might know: population, participation and productivity. so population is one of them, but it doesn't just support overall gdp growth for the country, but it supports gdp per capita growth because it does critically support our participation rate, because we tend to bring in people who are on average 26 years of age which is much younger than the overall average age for australians. and that means we've got a larger working-class population to support the ageing of the population. it also supports productivity as well because typically people that come into the country have higher skills or at least they've got higher qualifications than the average australian, so it does support productivity as well. so it is critically important. but we also need to make sure that we maintain the liveability of the cities, that we support the regions that need more people and that's where we need to balance that out and lean more strongly in. so our population settings though just aren't about immigration, they also are about other factors that we can put into place; the infrastructure to be aligned, working with the states and territories so we're planning better, faster rail to some of the satellite cities so that we can get growth in those satellites cities and economic growth is central in those smaller cities. laura jayes: are you not thinking about limiting how many children we can have here in australia are you? just checking. alan tudge: no laura, so we're all safe on that count, but immigration does constitute about 60 per cent of our overall population growth; natural factors about the other 40 per cent. laura jayes: just finally, perhaps looking at a scenario where you link the annual overseas migration intake to progress in infrastructure or to those skills shortages, so could there be a scenario where that cap, and i know you're not meeting the cap at the moment, that cap changes perhaps on a two yearly or five yearly or even annual basis? alan tudge: it's a good question laura, and it's almost precisely what we're endeavouring to do, is much more closely match our population growth with the infrastructure and housing approvals in the cities and the regions and we need to do that with the states and territories. so i'll be meeting up along with the treasurer, with the other treasurers later this month and then it will be at the leaders, we'll be talking about what we're calling a population planning framework and it's deliberately designed to do that. this centre for population though becomes the key repository of the information to support that effort. laura jayes: alan tudge, appreciate your time this morning. alan tudge: thanks very much laura. "], "press-conference-canberra-population-centre": ["04 October 2019", "alan tudge:  today we\u2019ve launched australia\u2019s centre for population which is going to be the key repository of everything to do with population in our country. it\u2019s going to do better forecasting, it\u2019s going to do greater transparency and it\u2019s going to help us manage our population growth better. australia is a fast-growing population. we\u2019ve done very well out of that but it also put immense pressure on our big capital cities and so we need to manage that better. we\u2019ve already put key things in place including slightly reducing the migration rate, we\u2019re encouraging more new people into the country to go to some of the regional areas and the smaller cities that want to grow more quickly. and we\u2019ve introduced more congestion-busting infrastructure. later this year we\u2019ll also be developing a framework with the states and territories to better align our respective responsibilities so that the infrastructure planning approvals, the services, are better aligned with the population growth in different parts of the country so that one is not going in front of the other. the centre though is the key element of pulling all of this together. victoria anderson has been appointed as the head of that centre and she will have a team by the end of the year of 20 people inside of treasury to undertake the research, provide the evidence base, to work with the states and territories, the academic community, the think tanks and to provide sound evidence-based public policy to governments. so this is the big day for australia. we\u2019ve got a plan to better manage our population growth going forward and the centre is going to be a key part of that. journalist:  why is it only happening now given how crucial it is to have accurate forecasts? alan tudge:  the prime minister as you probably know established the population portfolio about twelve months ago now and about six months or so ago we introduced our first population plan and that population plan has reduced the migration rate, encouraged more new people into the regions and some of the smaller cities. it outlined a fast rail plan, which will connect up the satellite cities of the big capitals so that people can live and work in geelong, for example, and be able to easily commute into the big capital city markets of melbourne. and it also outlined the fact that we\u2019re working more closely with the states and territories to better align our responsibilities. the centre though was in the may budget in terms of its funding. the funding started on 1 july this year and now we're officially launching it. it'll be at full capacity by the end of this year. journalist:  you\u2019ve already reduced the permanent migration intake in australia. are you going to continue to reduce that number? alan tudge:  so we've reduced the permanent migration intake from 190,000 cap down to 160,000 cap. we've already brought it down this year to about 162,000. the cap now over the next four years will be 160,000 and we've made that clear for the first time that we've outlined it over the forward estimates rather than just an annual one. then of course within the temporary migration settings we have created new incentives for the key components for the temporary migrants to go to some of the regional areas and smaller cities, particularly international students because 80 per cent of international students today go to melbourne, sydney or brisbane and yet they constitute the largest components of the temporary migration settings. so we've got incentives for the international students as well to go to some of the smaller cities in the regional areas. journalist:  with the population statement, what do you expect that to tell you that you don\u2019t already know and won\u2019t that just delay further action on tackling growth? alan tudge:  so we've already taken action as i\u2019ve outlined, and we outlined the initial steps in the first population plan just a few months ago. and further action will be taken. the population statement next year will provide a very transparent document of exactly what is occurring in our population settings; where the growth is, what the demographics are, the skills within our population and where the stresses are within our community as well. so it will be the annual snapshot of our population each year, creating that transparency. but in the meantime, we continue to do the policy work to better manage our population growth. journalist:  you mentioned the abs mispredicting population growth by about 3 million people. how can you be sure that this kind of research will have a better projection? alan tudge:  so in some respects, the abs has done projections rather than forecasts. now, what i mean by that is they\u2019ve looked backwards as to what has occurred in the past and assumed that that will continue into the future. whereas this population centre will be very much doing forecasts based on what is likely to occur in the future, what our policy settings are. and so it\u2019s more likely to be more accurate. and it will also be done at a more localised level as well. now, ideally, we had a common set of forecast across the country, because we find that in some areas, different jurisdictions will have their own forecasts, which are different to what our projections are. ideally we\u2019ve got a common set of forecasts so that everybody can plan accordingly. then, the equally important part of that is to track on an annual basis how we\u2019re going against those forecasts and adjust accordingly. journalist:  what do you think australians should take away from the prime minister\u2019s speech last night, with his warnings about negative globalism? alan tudge:  i think it was a very good speech that the prime minister outlines, talking about the fact that australia\u2019s interests are served by being engaged in the world but on our interests. and he talked about positive and practical globalism, and where it's done through our own interests. obviously, we're taking our interests into account as we engage with the broader community rather than necessarily being spoken to from other institutions, which aren't in our interests. journalist:  are you expecting more refugees to come to australia from the pacific due to climate change? alan tudge:  our humanitarian intake is set in terms of how people come into the country. we have a particular process. as you know, we've increased the humanitarian intake to 18,750 people each year and it will stay at that number. journalist:  that wouldn't change due to the forecast? alan tudge:  well we've got a cap in terms of the humanitarian intake. it's a generous cap, and we also have terrific settlement programs as well for when people do come into the country, and many make a terrific contribution when they\u2019re here. so that cap will be maintained. journalist:  when can we expect the final policy? alan tudge:  the final population policy? journalist:  yeah. alan tudge:  well, it's an ongoing piece of work. we outlined our initial population policy three to four months ago now. i provided an update to that policy just last week, and then the statements which will be produced annually will provide further updates as well. journalist:  how are you going to balance freedom of movement within the country when you want people to go to particular areas, when there are clear drivers moving people towards the big cities? alan tudge:  well we've put in place already some settings to encourage new people to consider going to an adelaide or a regional area rather than to a melbourne or sydney. now, this is not a radical concept, because we already do that already at a smaller scale and it's been shown to work. we have a 99.8 per cent compliance rate, and the evidence shows that 84 per cent of people are still in that location where they first went to five years afterwards. it's also been done very successfully and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve massively increased our expenditure on congestion-busting infrastructure. journalist:  do you consider yourself to have an ongoing mandate based on how the policy will develop over time? alan tudge: i don\u2019t understand that question. journalist:  well considering the policy isn\u2019t fully developed and is going to be changing based on this forecast, do you consider yourself to have an ongoing mandate based on the election or will you take something further at the next election in a few years? alan tudge: well we outlined our plan before the election. people understood our plan. we\u2019d already announced that we\u2019re reducing our migration rate. we\u2019d announced some of these incentives for new arrivals to go to some of the regional areas. we\u2019d already announced the fact that we\u2019re investing more economic development opportunities in some of the regional areas and the smaller cities. we\u2019d outlined our fast rail plan. we\u2019d increase the congesting-busting infrastructure to $100 billion as you know, and we have foreshadowed that we\u2019d work with the states and territories to develop a better population planning framework. so all of that work will continue. but of course, it\u2019s going to be ongoing work as the population continues to grow. "], "hobart-city-deal": ["03 October 2019", "in february this year the prime minister, premier and local mayors signed a commitment to hobart in a landmark agreement. designed by three levels of government, the hobart city deal will secure the fast growing tourism and science industries that are key to hobart and tasmania\u2019s future. now, just seven months later, we can show the people of hobart just how this design will be turned into results. the 10-year, $1.6 billion deal will unlock the city: \u00a0tackling congestion bottlenecks; boosting tourism; and make the airport a true international gateway, which will drive scientific investment and create an extra 720 jobs. today\u2019s release of the implementation plan sets out the next three years as the city deal is realised. it will take hobart from a great city, to an unbeatable one. most importantly it makes sure all city deal partners are accountable \u2013 it\u2019s making sure we put our money where our mouth is. we know what needs to be done to make this plan a reality, and the focus will be on key areas, backed with tangible actions to make sure we hit our marks. tasmania\u2019s tourism industry already supports 42,000 jobs.\u00a0that number will be boosted even further with a more direct gateway for international visitors and freight to be completed next year, with the start of international flights at hobart airport. the business case for an antarctic and science precinct will kick off before the end of this year. this will help cement hobart\u2019s position as the gateway to the antarctic and southern ocean including through establishing an antarctic and science precinct. as will the arrival of australia\u2019s new antarctic icebreaker, rsv nuyina, due in hobart in 2020. it will be the main lifeline to australia\u2019s antarctic and sub-antarctic research stations and the central platform of our antarctic and southern ocean scientific research. back on dry land, a combined more than $890 million in significant infrastructure investment \u2013 including construction of the new bridgewater bridge, jointly funded by the australian government ($461 million contribution) and tasmanian government ($115 million) - will start works to bust congestion and encourage the uptake of public transport. part of the greater hobart transport vision, design of upgrades to macquarie and davey streets will also commence this year, with construction expected to start as soon as possible. similar timelines are in place for the kingston congestion package. investment in affordable housing and improved planning is a key focus of the deal and is of increasing importance to the people of hobart. building a more diverse, affordable and inclusive housing mix is underway with the signing of contracts to build at least 100 new dwellings. the australia government committed $30\u00a0million to construction which will be complete in 2021. this is complemented by the central hobart precinct plan to be completed in 2021. the focus area includes 64 blocks between davey street, burnett street, brooker highway, molle and harrington streets. activating the northern suburbs transit corridor with a $25 million boost from the morrison government- has been a long time coming. we will have completed an options analysis on the most effective transport solution by the end of the year. work will then get underway on a project plan to deliver the infrastructure needed. a lot of the groundwork on a number of city deal projects is already complete and this plan is a blueprint on how we will continue to build on hobart\u2019s position as a vibrant, liveable and investment-ready city one of the great achievements already progressed, and now being implemented, is the greater hobart act. the act was collaboratively drafted and has now passed the tasmanian parliament, providing an enduring framework for strategic and shared integrated planning and decision making. like launceston, which we are both well aware of the first-hand impacts the city deal has had there, hobart will soon be thriving and benefitting from those same results. in hobart, and across southern tasmania, there is plenty to be excited about. much of it thanks to the game-changer that is the hobart city deal. a game-changer for hobart, and a game-changer for tasmania. this city deal has come together through the hard-work of both the morrison and hodgman liberal governments, and we look forward to continuing to deliver for the greater hobart region in partnership with local government. i encourage the people

"press-conference-hobart-hobart-city-deal": ["03 October 2019", "eric abetz: welcome everybody to a glorious hobart, clarence, glenorchy and kingborough day. we are in the greater hobart area for the implementation plan of the city deal to be announced. this is a great collaboration between federal, state and local governments and as a local senator from this area it's a delight to be able to welcome the federal minister, the state minister, the lord mayor who will speak on behalf of the mayors, but all the mayors as well, for this important occasion.\nthe weather's great. you look over our shoulders here, you can see the aurora australis which will be replaced or part and parcel of what we are planning for the future of hobart in the greater hobart area over the next 10 years. so if i may, welcome minister and look forward to your comments. alan tudge: thank you very much senator. well thank you very much eric, and mr ferguson, and to the lord mayor and the other mayors who are here. this is a great day for tasmania and just earlier this year we made a series of promises to hobart and tasmania. today we outlined the implementation plans to deliver upon those promises with action beginning immediately. and as you'll see this is a plan, not just for hobart but for the whole island because there are commitments in here which will really turbo charge the economy across the state. and i'd like just to mention a few of the ones which are mentioned in this document. first up of course the we would now, by the end of next year, we'll have the capacity for international flights to be taking off from hobart itself. now that will be a boon for tourism right across the state but will also be a boon for industry in the state as well because you could imagine the fresh produce which is produced here so well will be able to be produced and cut one day, and potentially on the flight and into asia the next day. so it'll really make a difference for the economy as well as for the tourists who'll be coming here to visit this wonderful island. second i\u2019d talk about the antarctic and science precinct which will be developed on macquarie point behind us. tasmania is already known as being one of the world's experts in antarctic research and this implementation plan will absolutely secure this, and we've got work which will be underway soon. the business case, looking at how that can be further developed and attract private investment as well as potential other public investments, will be underway very shortly. as the senator mentioned the new icebreaker will be coming next year so it's all happening in relation to that. i'd also mentioned in this plan hundreds of millions of dollars of congestion busting infrastructure, of course the biggest one of those being the bridgewater bridge. there's further work to be done on that next year with infrastructure australia but then we want to get it under construction by 2022. it needs to be built, we\u2019re 100 per cent committed to seeing it built along with the state government and that's one of the key commitments in here along with other key pieces of infrastructure as well. including actually, since we announced the city deal an extra $130 million of commitment from the federal government towards the tasmanian highway between, from hobart to sorell was the first one of the projects within that envelope, kicking off next year and will be absolutely underway. finally, i\u2019d just mention as a highlight of this, the affordable housing package and as you'll see we've got $30 million allocated to build 100 new social houses by the end of 2021. so in all cases across here we've got stated timelines and commitments to get going on all of these important announcements which we've already made. we want to get the action done. the document itself outlines kpi\u2019s, it outlines the funding, it outlines the implementation plans and we're getting cracking immediately. this has, as senator abetz said, been a great piece of work across the three levels of government and i'd like to just commend the state government, minister ferguson, as well as the mayors who are here today, for the cooperative way that they've worked together with us to pull this document together. this is about making tasmania an even stronger economy and even better place to live. eric abetz: and now state minister ferguson. michael ferguson: thank you alan and thank you to our local government mayors as well, and to eric. it's great to be here and this is an important delivery as the deal was only signed in february. this $1.6 billion arrangement between all three levels of government is a comprehensive team effort to help the city of greater hobart, the cities that make up hobart, and the greater hobart area to set it up for the next generation. we want to leave decisions that are helping to establish this as a great place to live, as a safe community but one which is economically vibrant, one where people are healthy, one where families can enjoy this wonderful community. and importantly that we can deal with some of the growing pains that we've been experiencing particularly through traffic congestion, the need for more affordable housing, the need to activate the northern corridor, and ensuring that we can indeed get the produce to market just as alan has indicated. another mention that i'd like to specifically make here is that the macquarie point development is vital here. it's been strongly supported by all of us here and it's one of the ways that we're going to make hobart the antarctic and science gateway that it already is and that we can enhance. work is underway in every one of the areas that has been signed up to in the hobart deal. vitally, in february, all of us made a commitment that we would deliver an implementation plan. now many of you in the media would be well aware of the hodgman government's, we've made a virtue out of setting out in advance what our key deliverables are and holding ourselves to account. well this is exactly the same, that we all here today, have made commitments to so that not just the federal government, not just the local councils, but also the state government can indicate what our respective commitments are as our contributions to meeting these goals and the timeframes that are involved. and so far, everybody is keeping their commitments and that's to be applauded. we've got a lot of work yet to do because the community are now looking to us to deliver. and the implementation plan that we're releasing today will be updated annually; it's a three-year implementation timeframe. each year we\u2019ll set out the further three years and that means that over the life of this deal that the people of tasmania and of course, especially of hobart and the surrounding municipal areas, can have complete confidence that the commitments that are being made are going to be delivered on time and in a way that enhances the life and lifestyle of people in southern tasmania. so i thank in particular the commonwealth and our four local councils for the very constructive way in which we've been able to work together collaboratively by agreement. and i would also like to conclude on this point - we know that there will be future opportunities that will come through and we will work through those also, extra and greater than what is already in the current deal. and if there are infrastructure or liveability or housing initiatives that are offered, then we'll work through those and find a pathway for funding and delivery of those as well - potentially they could even be added into the city deal. i thank all of our colleagues for the teamwork and that we now give a commitment that we will crack on and deliver this. eric abetz: and now the lord mayor. anne reynolds: thank you. well thanks everyone for coming today. and i'm speaking on behalf of the four mayors from hobart, glenorchy, clarence and kingborough. we're very excited about the fact that we're starting a new era of collaboration and cooperation amongst the three levels of government. what the deal and this implementation provides is a really, a sense of focus on where we're going to put our effort, where we're going to work together. the local government in particular is very keen to see the work that's going to be done in affordable housing and more public transport and easing traffic congestion because we know that these are issues that our communities are struggling with and they would like to see action in that area. so we're very keen that to see that all of these issues are highlighted in this implementation plan and there is a way forward. the other thing to note is that this is a living document as minister ferguson said. this isn't everything that will happen in the city deal over the next 10 years, it is going to be a document that we work together, we update and we add to over time. and we're really looking forward to that opportunity to work with state and federal in a much more focused, coordinated and collaborative way to actually ensure that our city grows and develops in a really sustainable and a way that is great for the people who live here. eric abetz: questions? journalist:  are all four mayors happy and councils happy that the bridgewater bridge is going forward? anne reynolds: yes, certainly we recognise that the bridgewater bridge is a key part of this deal. all four councils have formally acknowledged the advice of the infrastructure australia in our decisions about the implementation plan and we are going to continue the conversation about the options and the design options for the bridgewater bridge. but that's all part of the conversation that we'll be having with state and federal government. but certainly we recognise that the bridgewater bridge, a bridge crossing is a really fundamental and central part of this deal. journalist:  just for minister tudge, just on the bridgewater bridge. there are local councils that say that the money could be better spent. why is the government continuing to go ahead with the plan as it stands? eric abetz: well, there are other councils that agree. alan tudge: we made a commitment to this. we've got $461 million on the table to get it built and we're going to deliver on that commitment. it's outlined in this document here and we absolutely will deliver on our commitments that we promised to the people of tasmania. now infrastructure australia has also said that that bridge is nearing the end of its natural life. it's obviously a single lane each way and it needs to be broader than that. so it is- still has it on its priority list. what is required though is for the state government to work with us to update the design in keeping with the infrastructure australia requirements and then we get on with it. journalist:  but why not update the plans potentially to make it significantly cheaper to build? alan tudge: if it can be done more affordably, then terrific, but the key thing is that it has to be built, and that's what both the federal government and the state government have committed to doing and working in cooperation with them alongside infrastructure australia to see it built. journalist:  i'm not sure who wants to step in on this one so i\u2019ll just throw it broadly. just a little bit about the airport upgrade and what people can expect to see. i\u2019m not sure who. alan tudge: i\u2019ll say in relation to that, obviously from the federal government's perspective we've spent money extending the runway and in this deal here we've got over $80 million to ensure that there is border security in place for international flights to take off from the end of next year. and then, our expectation is and what we have heard is that it's highly likely then that there will be international flights taking off at the end of next year, but obviously that needs to be negotiated with individual airlines to actually come in and out of hobart.\nbut it would make such a big difference to the economy here. as i said, from a tourism perspective, your international tourist numbers are already growing by about 10 per cent per annum at the moment. you put an international airport here and that will absolutely take off. and that means jobs right here in hobart and across tasmania; but it also is so critical for the export industries, and tasmania is renowned across australia as having such great fresh produce produced here. and as i was saying earlier, you can imagine it being picked one day and literally on the plane and into asia the next. journalist:  what destinations could we expect to see when international flights commence? alan tudge: most likely, i would expect into asia. but obviously that would be decisions which are made by the airlines themselves with the hobart airport. journalist:  when will that be known by? alan tudge: my expectation is that this will be known towards the end of next year. so, we put in place through this deal and through the investments which we've already made, the capacity for international aircraft to take off by the end of next year, particularly through the $80 million commitment for the border security services to be in place, which is the critical thing which is required, so now they can go ahead. journalist:  what point of next year is it expected they\u2019ll be in place? alan tudge: again, these will be negotiations which individual airlines will strike to make the determination. we're providing the capacity for international airlines to be able to take off from the end of next year, and our full expectation is that they will. journalist:  what's been the level of interest from airlines in terms of putting a service in and out of hobart? alan tudge: my expectation is that they will start the end of next year. i understand there has been some interest and i know the airport is already working on it. journalist:  what\u2019s happening in the short term to bust congestion on the roads? what\u2019s going to be seen immediately? michael ferguson (*): look, it's a vital point actually, and in the implementation plan you will see that a range of initiatives are already in place, and indeed we're already in the market right now, currently, for the additional capacity on the southern outlet. in the coming weeks, you'll see further advertisements being placed for initiatives that are going to support the investigation of the northern transport corridor, and in the very near future we'll be releasing the results of our tender process for the hobart airport interchange. so, this is a 10-year deal with a three-year implementation plan. but we are already taking action in line with the government's previously stated commitments at the state election and at the federal election. journalist:  how advanced is the discussions around the northern suburbs transit corridor? michael ferguson (*): well very mature actually, and working with our local government colleagues and the state and federal government, we're actually advancing a piece of work that will investigate: what is the best way to activate that corridor? we're all taking an open mind to this in terms of the way it should best be delivered in a way that's feasible and meets the needs of our community. and that will in fact be going to a tender specifically for that piece of work, that study, in the next week. alan tudge: and we have $25 million there. michael ferguson (*): it\u2019s suts set out within the plan to get more people to use public transport and carpool are realistic for tasmanians? michael ferguson (*): they are ambitious but they need to be. our city's been growing and it's met capacity in terms of the congestion issues that people who regularly use the streets of hobart are experiencing. that is a good problem to have, because it means that more people are making their home here and getting jobs, and where we've seen that increase in economic activity it is, however, causing congestion issues. we need to deal with that, and the government, working with our councils, is absolutely determined to ensure that we do open up more capacity so that more people can use our roads efficiently. but the public transport piece is a vital one as well. and you will see as part of the work that we're doing, for example, on the park and ride and the fifth lane on the southern outlet that, in fact, that's a stated goal \u2013 of encouraging more people to use public transport. and we'll certainly have more to say about that in future months. journalist:  just a couple on other issues if that\u2019s alright? eric abetz: yeah, two more questions, yeah but on this topic. anymore on the deal, and then we\u2019ll go to other issues? alright, other issues.

what are you going to do? adrian schrinner: we're looking at two options at the moment. so we've put it out to consultation. people are really keen to get involved in that. we've had hundreds of people get involved in the consultation already. one of the options is already coming out as a strong favourite but we will wait until the consultation closes before making a decision on that. but ultimately, those two options will be narrowed down to a preferred option and then we can get on with the project. question: what are those? adrian schrinner: yeah. both options include signalisation of this intersection, so replacing the roundabout with traffic signals. one of those options includes an overpass, giving a smooth run through for mobile road traffic but also reducing the accidents and improving the safety here as well. both options will bring a major benefit to safety, but there will also be other benefits as well, freeing up capacity, creating more opportunity for people to move smoothly through this area. but there'll be benefits for pedestrians and cyclists with those options as well. so providing alternatives to private vehicle travel as well. question: how do you prioritise which projects actually start first? adrian schrinner: well, different sized projects have different planning phases. consultation is a critical part of every single project we do. we're under consultation at the moment for the indooroopilly roundabout. there's more consultation on the other projects that will be kicking off soon. once we've got the community\u2019s feedback on board, we can get the best outcome and then move forward with the project. question: have any of these not been announced before? adrian schrinner: well, there are projects that have been announced with federal government funding. what is being announced for the first time today is the level of council contribution into these projects. and so, the council's contribution has not been announced before. that was new information. the federal contribution, in most cases, was announced in the lead up to the last federal election in may. and so, we're coming to the table, adding and leveraging up the federal government investment to generate a half a billion-dollar fund to fight traffic congestion and make our roads safer. question: sorry, i missed it. how much is the council contributing? alan tudge: i'll just add to that. all of these projects were announced by the federal government leading up to the last election and in some cases, they were election promises. today we're announcing that we're getting on with the job, planning for them, setting the timetable for them to be constructed. as i said, all of these are going to be under construction within 12 to 24 months with the first one beginning early next year. we want to get on with the job, busting congestion across brisbane, and that's what these projects are going to do. question: minister, some of them were announced in january. so by the time that happens, it would be three years. that\u2019s a long time for people to wait. alan tudge: it depends on which ones you\u2019re referring to. some of them, like this one, will take a little bit of time to do the consultation work. it\u2019s a larger scale project. but most of the projects we\u2019ve announced over the last six or eight months leading up to the election campaign, the funding has kicked in from 1 july. so since 1 july we've now got the commitments with the brisbane city council to get these jobs done over the next 12 to 24 months. as i\u2019ve said, the first one is beginning construction early next year and we want to see all of them underway as quickly as possible; we\u2019re working cooperatively with the brisbane city council to do just that. question: when did you get that cooperation? when was that signed off on? how much are you getting? alan tudge: so we\u2019ve just agreed this over the last few weeks. we\u2019ve had constant negotiations with brisbane city council over these particular projects into our contribution, their contribution and what the timeframe is going to look like. and today, we\u2019re announcing that we\u2019re getting on with these. question: so you don\u2019t need anything from the state? alan tudge: these nine ones which are jointly funded by the federal government and the brisbane city council; there\u2019s two others which the brisbane city council, and you might want to comment on these, two other level crossings, which are going to be removed and that will be a tripartite arrangement on those two level crossings. question: lord mayor, if i could just get your adrian schrinner: yup. sure. question: so what is the council contributing to this project? adrian schrinner: so out of this $500 million fund, it's approximately 50/50, it\u2019s split between the federal government and the council. and so when you include the open level crossing contributions from both sides, you're getting to a five hundred-million-dollar fund which is approximately 50/50. so council\u2019s coming to the table with real money, investing in these projects, leveraging up the federal government investment. so the other thing i could say about the timeframe of these projects is all of these projects until this point have had no timeframe; there has not been funding available to deliver them. so they were not projects that were going to happen unless we got this agreement in place. now, we have a situation where they can move forward; we can get on with it. and so starting early next year, the first works will commence, and then progressively over the coming months and years we'll see these projects delivered. question: is this the first project we're going to see? and yeah and when you say early next year what time are we actually talking about? adrian schrinner: we're expecting the first project to be the commercial and northern road upgrade in newstead and that is one of the early projects to kick off with, is a smaller project in nature so we can get it going faster. but we will do a consultation within the coming weeks, so that we can start construction the first half of next year. question: sorry if i\u2019m missing something but if the federal contribution is $115 million where\u2019s the, and you\u2019re saying it\u2019s 50/50? adrian schrinner: so that contribution was towards the nine projects. there's also additional contributions from the federal government towards the open level crossings. question: but are they not assured? yeah? adrian schrinner: well basically, those open level crossings require tripartite agreements so we require the state coming to the table. the federal government has provided funding for the state to do planning studies for those open level crossings. that work is underway. what we need to hear back from state is the priority that they want to determine for each of these crossings. question: so the federal government won\u2019t commit until the state government commits? adrian schrinner: no. both of the two parties have committed. so the council and the federal government have got money on the table and made the commitment. it's up to the state now to determine which project happens first and also to put in their share of the funding. so traditionally, these projects have been funded in the majority by the state government. usually, it's 85 per cent by the state government, 15 per cent by council. in this case, we see a tripartite agreement with money coming from three levels of government, that i am aware is a first in recent times in queensland. so i'm not aware of anything in recent times in the last 20 years where the federal government has put money into open level crossings in brisbane. so this is a great thing and it will help bring these projects up the priority list. question: minister, just on another issue if i may, would you like to see australia and china have closer ties? alan tudge: just let me, firstly just address this point in terms of level crossings as well. so we have made financial commitments to the two level crossings, the linden level crossing and the coopers plains. in linden\u2019s case, we\u2019ve made an $85 million commitment and coopers plains level crossing a $73 million commitment. there's also commitments from the brisbane city council. so all up, our federal commitments to these nine projects which we've agreed the time schedule on, plus the two level crossings comes to over $250 million, which as the lord mayor, it\u2019s being managed. now, in relation to the, sorry, what was the question? question: ties with china. would you like to see australia have closer ties? alan tudge: i mean, we have a good relationship with china and of course, we have a very strong strategic relationship with the united states, and we've been able to balance that well and will continue to do so. question: the chinese state media are reporting that china says australia faces a hundred years of solitude if it continues ties with america in terms of its military ties. should everyday australians be concerned about something like that quite strongly? alan tudge: i'm not aware of those comments from the chinese state media and you might put those to the foreign minister. julian simmonds: there\u2019s just a couple of points that i wanted to make. we're standing here at indooroopilly in front of the most congested and unsafe roundabouts in the whole city, and just to show you how quickly projects can move when you have the kind of cooperation that we have between the federal government and the brisbane city council is that at the start of this year we didn't have anything more than an understanding of the congestion problem that we had here in indooroopilly and some land that the council had baked. now, we're just a few short months down the track and we have money on the table from the federal government, money on the table from the council. we have options out there for community consultation, and a commitment to see this project underway in the next 12 to 24 months. now, that's going to be a huge benefit to residents in the western suburbs. and the other point i wanted to make is to remember that if infrastructure is a wonderful thing but it's not an end in itself. it\u2019s so that we can get local residents home to their families sooner and safer. \u00a0these kind of urban congestion spots, not on main highways, but they are the type of intersections that our mums and dads drive through every day on the weekend, take their kids to sport on the weekends, go and do the shopping and so to have the benefit of a new signalised intersection rather than this unsafe and congested roundabout will mean a lot to the residents of the western suburbs. and i'd like to thank the federal government for putting in the funding, but also the brisbane city council and lord mayor adrian schrinner. they know how to produce congestion busting outcomes and projects, and so it's great to be partnering with them to get this project done. question: sorry. can i have a comment on, is the council planning to do anything about the number of full buses that couldn\u2019t pick up passengers last night? adrian schrinner: absolutely. look, that is a great question. we saw another release of information just overnight of the number of full buses we're seeing particularly on the busway network, the most heavily congested and fullest buses are on the bus way on route 66. this route will be replaced. "], "infrastructure-agreement-bust-congestion-across-brisbane": ["24 September 2019", "a congestion-busting agreement landed today between the morrison government and the brisbane city council will mean nine urban congestion fund projects will commence construction within 12 to 24 months. over the next few years, brisbane will continue to have a steady pipeline of infrastructure projects going out the door, creating jobs and busting congestion. the delivery of the nine critical, federal infrastructure projects will help reshape the city by eliminating some of brisbane\u2019s most notorious traffic hotspots. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said kicking off construction on the nine urban congestion fund projects was one of his top priorities for brisbane. \u201cthese projects will bust congestion, they will deliver life-saving road safety improvements and they will bolster commuter and freight connections that underpin the state and national economies,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cthe morrison government promised we will get the people of brisbane home sooner and safer, and we will deliver.\u201d\u00a0 the projects form part of the coalition\u2019s more than $25 billion for transport infrastructure in brisbane between 2013\u201314 and 2028\u201329, including $9.8\u00a0billion over the next four years alone. brisbane lord mayor adrian schrinner said he looked forward to working with the morrison government to deliver the new better roads for brisbane initiative. \u00a0 \u201cbrisbane is a great place to live, work and relax, and i want to get residents out of traffic and able to spend more time doing what they love,\u201d cr schrinner said. \u201cgreat outcomes can be achieved when different levels of government work collaboratively together for the greater good of residents and we are looking forward to working with the morrison government to jointly fund and deliver these projects. \u201ci have a clear vision for the future of our city and we are committed to managing growth, building better transport networks while protecting our fantastic quality of life. \u201cthe lnp is committed to better roads for brisbane that will slash travel times, help save lives and support economic benefits and more jobs.\u201d the nine projects that constitute this agreement are: the australian government and brisbane city council will also work with the queensland government to remove the lindum rail level crossing and the coopers plains level crossing. planning for both of these projects is underway. "], "plan-better-manage-our-population-growth": ["23 September 2019", "thank you for the invitation to speak at your population summit. you have an impressive agenda and i look forward to hearing from some of your other panelists. scott morrison created the population portfolio when he first became prime minister a little over a year ago. it was recognition that our population settings have a fundamental impact on our economic growth as well as the liveability of our cities and regions. it literally impacts us all, both directly and indirectly. our government has been busy since this time, and today i want to launch our updated population plan and in doing so, outline its key elements as well as the rationale for it. australia has done tremendously well from our population settings over the decades. it has underpinned our gdp growth and it has made our cities vibrant and cosmopolitan, while enabling some of our regional centres to thrive. on the other hand, we have been challenged by the pace and distribution of our population growth in recent years, putting enormous pressure on our big capitals. we also have many places that want to grow, but simply can't get the workforce they need. our challenge now, and the reason we need a population plan, is to maximise our economic potential through our population settings while maintaining the liveability of our cities. in order to unpack this challenge, we need to go to the numbers. australia has a fast growing population\u2014presently at about 1.6 per cent per annum.\u00a0 the primary driver of this growth is international migration which accounts for 60 per cent. to put this into perspective, our population growth rate is more than double that of the united states and over two and a half times the oecd average. our population growth, and the migration settings that support it, have been key drivers of our economic growth overall. as you would no doubt know, population is one of the 3ps of economic growth with the other two being participation and productivity.\u00a0\u00a0 however, our settings have impacted all three \u201cps\u201d, not just the one. our migration settings are deliberately geared toward younger, skilled people, which means it has supported increased labour force participation and improved productivity. this means that, over the decades, our population settings haven't just contributed to gdp growth, but have contributed to gdp per capita growth. that is, we have each, on average, become wealthier because of our population settings. treasury estimated that a sixth of our per capita wealth over the last 40 years is due to population factors. but this growth has put pressure on the liveability of our cities, especially when infrastructure, housing approvals and services have not kept pace. this has been the case over the last decade or two in sydney and melbourne, and to a lesser extent in south east queensland. in sydney's case, the infrastructure is partially catching up due to the huge expenditure by the state government over the last few years (supported by the federal coalition), with many projects now opening, or due to open, in the next year or two. in melbourne, however, we are a decade behind. our big city freeways have slowed in pace, the trains are frequently at crush capacity, and housing construction has not always kept up, putting upward pressure on prices. people in the outer suburbs are particularly feeling the congestion pressure as their commutes have become longer. for example, in my home town of melbourne, a 30km inner freeway journey in peak morning traffic took 39 minutes ten years ago. now it takes an hour. the hilda survey stated commuters now spend 60 per cent more time in traffic per day than they did 15 years ago. infrastructure australia says, based on data and policy settings from 12 months ago, that this situation will only get worse in the next decade. more infrastructure is necessary and our government has doubled the infrastructure investment to $100\u00a0billion since coming to office. i will come back to this later. but our challenges are exacerbated by population distribution factors, and there are two in particular. first, while we have had rapid population growth nationally, the growth is not evenly distributed geographically. to the contrary, 75 percent of the nation's entire population growth has been into three areas: melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. those cities have been growing very quickly by any benchmark of large wealthy cities. melbourne, for example, grew the fastest with 2.5 per cent growth last year, sydney at 1.8 per cent and south east queensland 2.2 per cent. on the other hand, there are parts of australia that are crying out for more people. in fact there are currently around 60,000 job vacancies in the regions alone. and there are smaller cities like adelaide, where the leaders are publicly calling for faster growth. the second distribution issue is that most people and most of the population growth is in the outer suburbs of our big cities, yet most of the jobs growth has been in the city centres. this puts extra pressure on city infrastructure as more people commute significant distances each day. for example, between 2011 and 2016, sydney's inner suburbs added more jobs than people\u201490,000 jobs for 75,000 more working-age people. but in the outer suburbs, we saw the opposite\u2014160,000 people added but only 75,000 jobs. the grattan institute finds that half of all jobs growth in sydney and melbourne is within a 2km radius of their city centres. our population plan is designed to support economic growth, but also in part to have an impact on these two main distribution issues.\u00a0 while we don't want, and nor would it be feasible, to have some grand master planned australia, we do need to take a stronger position on our settlement patterns using the policy levers at our disposal. the risk otherwise is that in 30 or 40 years' time, australia will end up with two or three megacities, but relatively sparse development elsewhere. i don't think this is the desired outcome of most australians, nor in our strategic interest. our big cities will continue to grow and we need to plan better for this growth, but other wealthy countries show that focused government policy can assist in getting a broader distribution of population growth. canada, for example, has used migration as an effective policy lever (which i will come back to), while countries like germany, france and others have used fast rail to better manage settlement patterns. so let me take you through some of the key elements of our population plan to deal with some of these issues i have raised. a. reduced migration rate. the first step has been to reduce the migration rate. as i mentioned earlier, international migration comprises 60 per cent of our population growth. however, it is an ever larger proportion of the growth of our big cities\u201465 per cent of melbourne's growth and 83 per cent of sydney's. given the enormous pressure on our big cities, our government has brought the permanent migration rate down from 190,000 to 160,300 this year, and we will cap it at 160,000 over the next four years. importantly, however, we have preserved the skilled migration numbers within this cap. permanent migration is the smaller component of the net overseas migration (nom) figure\u2014with temporary migration being the larger\u2014but it is the primary determinant of population growth over the medium term. b. regional migration. the second step has been to put in place incentives for new arrivals to our nation to go to regional centres and to the smaller cities. these incentives include: \tas of july of this year, students who study in areas outside the big capitals will receive an extra additional year of post-study work rights. this will then provide those students with the full three years of work rights required to be eligible for permanent residency. based on my conversations with vice chancellors across the country, this will be a powerful incentive. the government has also initiated 4,720 scholarships for both domestic and international students to study in the regions. the government is continuing to look at this avenue of supporting regional growth through migration including through the work of a new parliamentary inquiry chaired by julian leeser. canada provides an interesting case study in how migration policy can achieve a better distribution of population growth. they are a country remarkably similar to ours: geographically, economically, and in political structure. beginning in the 90s, canada gave the provinces a much greater role in nominating and selecting migrants into the country. according to uts's professor jock collins, this has helped to \u201cdramatically shift the settlement of immigrants beyond canada's biggest cities.\u201d before the changes, only 10% of economic migrants settled outside of canada's big three provinces. as of 2017, this figure had risen to 34%. while there is no requirement for new immigrants to stay in the province that has nominated them, the evidence is that the vast majority settle in that province. according to collins, a big part of this retention success was the strong emphasis placed on ensuring that the migrants received a strong welcome, support programs, a community network and assistance in finding work for those who were not employer sponsored. this program is one example of a \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach to migration. as is outlined above, we have started this process in australia. c. fast rail connecting orbital regional centres. a further step in our plan is to build fast rail connections between the big capitals and their respective regional centres surrounding them. our ambition is that within 20 years, most of the satellite cities of melbourne, sydney and brisbane are connected. the opportunity from this is that it would enable people to live in a regional centre and have the lifestyle and cheaper housing associated with that, yet still be able to access the larger city employment market on a daily basis. this would have a profound impact on our settlement pattern\u2014turbo-charging the regional centres while taking pressure off the big capitals. research undertaken for geelong council, for example, estimates that if melbourne's satellite centres were connected by fast rail, a million extra people would base themselves in regional victoria rather than in melbourne by 2050. while this is a medium to long term plan, we have started the process. we have established a fast rail agency to provide expertise and oversee this process; put money towards several business cases, with the first three completed within months; and allocated $2\u00a0billion to get the first fast rail connection built as quickly as possible: melbourne to geelong. d. economic development of regions and smaller cities. for sustained growth in smaller cities and regions, you need jobs. connectivity, university campuses and other parts mentioned above help in this effort, but so can direct government economic development policy. this is the next element of the plan. decentralising the public service can be part of this, which minister coulton oversees. about fourteen per cent of public service jobs are already based in the regions with more to come. this provides a stable basis of employment in regional areas. a quarter of defence force jobs are located in the regions, with an extensive network of bases providing employment and community growth. private sector investment in the regions and smaller cities provides the most important role, so we're investing heavily in the infrastructure necessary to attract more businesses to our regions. the government also has dedicated programs to support growth. the $841\u00a0million building better regions fund and $272\u00a0million regional growth fund are key initiatives which are creating jobs and driving economic growth. as is the $500\u00a0million in additional funding to improve regional education. this investment strengthens regional higher education through greater access to university places, study hubs and scholarships. e. more congestion busting infrastructure. the challenge in our big cities comes from the supply of infrastructure, housing, and services not keeping pace with the demand created by population growth. i have outlined some of our plans to take population pressure off the big cities and support growth elsewhere. the supply side of the equation\u2014transport infrastructure, housing and services\u2014are primarily the responsibility of the states and territories, but our government is strongly supporting the states in this area. since coming to office, our government has more than doubled the investment in transport infrastructure to over $100\u00a0billion over the next ten years. a third of the 900 major projects that we have announced since coming to office have been announced in the last 6 months alone.\u00a0 our $100\u00a0billion infrastructure pipeline includes major projects such as westconnex and northconnex here in sydney, the monash freeway upgrades, m80 upgrades and the melbourne airport rail link in melbourne and the gateway and m1 pacific motorways in brisbane. these are the major spines of our big cities and our investments are already having an impact. the new m4 tunnel for example, which opened a couple of months ago, is saving commuters travelling between parramatta and the cbd 20 minutes in the morning peak and 45 minutes in the evening peak\u2014each day. on top of this, we have committed funding to support 166 smaller scale projects in our suburbs. they are targeted at local pinch points and include 46 commuter car parks designed to take up to 25,000 cars off the roads. we have work underway on each one of these 166 projects and expect the first to be under construction before christmas. f. better population planning with the states. the final element of our plan that i would like to mention today is the instituting of better population planning mechanisms with the states and territories. one of the challenges of our federation is that the primary population lever\u2014immigration\u2014is set at the federal level, while states, territories and local governments have the primary responsibility for the transport infrastructure, housing approvals and service provision to cater for the growth. we need to ensure that these are better aligned so that one does not get in front of the other as occurred in sydney when premier carr said that sydney was full and stopped building for the future, while prime minister rudd turbo-charged the migration rate a few years later, accelerating the growth into sydney. there are two mechanisms we are putting in place to get better alignment across government and to better plan for the inevitable growth that will continue in our big cities. the first is \u201ccity deals\u201d. the city deal model, which our government pioneered several years ago, is a good mechanism for better planning across the three levels of government. they typically set out long term plans for infrastructure, employment and housing. we are presently working on four new city deals in each of south east queensland, perth, south east melbourne and north west melbourne. they complement the other \u201ccity deals\u201d already in place including the largest to date\u2014the western sydney city deal. this agreement outlines a 20 year plan for western sydney's development with the aim that people can live, work and play in the area. the centrepiece, of course, is the huge federally funded $5.3\u00a0billion western sydney airport. \u00a0\u00a0 the western sydney city deal, which has been widely lauded, directly supports the nsw government's vision to effectively have three centres in sydney, not one: the cbd, parramatta and western sydney. the second mechanism is the instituting of a more formal national population and planning framework with states and territories and the australian local government association. this framework, negotiated at coag, aims to link up the policy responsibilities that each level of government has so that we can collectively better manage our growth into the future. it will result in tangible and specific outcomes, including better population projections and data sharing, and a focus on skills requirements at a regional level. work is well advanced on the framework and we expect it to be agreed at the next coag meeting in december. today, i have outlined some of the opportunities and challenges we face from our population growth as well as the key elements of our plan to better manage our growth into the future. there are further details in the updated population plan that i am launching today. the plan is aimed at ensuring that population settings continue to support national economic growth, while maintaining the liveability of our big cities and growth of our smaller cities and regions. our starting point is an enviable one: an economy in its 28th year of uninterrupted economic growth, some of the most liveable cities in the world, and regions which are prosperous and welcoming. but there is more to do and we are not complacent. our population plan will serve australia's future well. thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.

cities while addressing skill shortages in regional towns, and working to meet the changing demands on infrastructure and government services,\u201d he said. mr tudge said the expanded plan includes the following key elements: the updated plan can be found here: https://population.gov.au/downloads/planning-future-population.pdf "], "doorstop-sydney": ["23 September 2019", "alan tudge: well today i'm launching our updated population plan. this is a plan to underpin our future prosperity but also take pressure off our big capital cities while supporting the growth of our regions and our smaller cities. we outlined the intent of this plan just six months ago, but this detailed document goes through the elements to support that intent. australia generally has done very well out of our population settings over the decades. it has supported our economic growth both on an absolute basis, as well as a per capita basis. it's made our cities more cosmopolitan and vibrant and it has supported growth in our regions. but there are real challenges also which have come about from having a fast-growing population and particularly those challenges are felt in our big capital cities which have grown tremendously quickly over the last decade putting enormous pressure on our infrastructure. and many australians who live in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland in particular are really feeling the congestion pressures. so this plan outlines a series of initiatives to take a bit of pressure off those big capital cities while supporting the regions and the smaller cities, often which are wanting more people to go there and wanting to grow more quickly. so the plan itself outlines a series of initiatives and let me take you through some of those. first up it outlines that we've reduced the migration rates from 190,000 per annum to now a cap of 160,000 per annum. and second, within that migration rate we've created incentives for new arrivals to our country, to consider going to some of the smaller cities and the regions rather than just going to melbourne and sydney which they tend to do at the moment. third then, to support that, we're outlining a vision over the next two decades to connect the satellite cities of the big capital cities to fast rail. and you could imagine if you have fast rail connecting from say newcastle to sydney and sydney to wollongong or from melbourne to geelong, or ballarat and bendigo then people can live and enjoy the lifestyle of that regional centre yet still be able to access the capital city markets from that particular place on a daily basis. the next element is continued investments in regional developments. we're doing that through decentralisation of our public service through investment in places like adelaide of defence expenditure and of course through a number of programs which support regional growth across the country. fifth, we're massively increasing the investment in infrastructure particularly into our big capital cities. we acknowledge that despite these settings we've put in place, our big capital cities are still going to grow and we have to plan accordingly and we need the infrastructure to keep up. now this is primarily the responsibility of the state governments. but our government has doubled the infrastructure expenditure to now a record $100\u00a0billion over the course of the decade to support the growth of those capital cities. and then the final element that i'll mention here today is better planning mechanisms between the federal government and the states and territories so that we don't have some of the challenges that we have today into the future. we need to better align the levers which the federal government has with the levers which the state and territory governments have. because at federal level we have the primary responsibility for the population growth rate, being the migration settings, while the states and territories are primarily responsible for the infrastructure, for the housing approvals and the services to support that growth. and we need to make sure those are better aligned. and so we'll be developing a population planning framework with the states and territories through the coag process and that we hope will be approved by december. overall though this is a good plan to manage australia's population growth better. it will underpin our prosperity going forward. it takes pressure off the big capital cities while supporting the growth and the aspirations of the smaller cities and the regions which want more people and often need more people for the jobs which are available. i'm happy to take any questions. question: population it's an important, it's a serious concern for some people. how does a summit like today help bring about change? alan tudge: today's summit has been an excellent one in bringing many experts to the table to discuss some of the policy settings and what can be done. we heard from rob stokes this morning, the planning minister, and his view as to how cities should be managed better and indeed how australia should be managed better. and there's further experts today including the head of infrastructure australia and the head of the greater sydney commission and other experts will be discussing issues which need to be addressed. question: and on another matter, the east west link. what route do you think the east west link should take? is it the one designed in 2014 or should it be the one that connects an updated route that will connect the eastern freeway and the west gate tunnel? alan tudge: well the key thing is we need an east-west road to connect the eastern freeway so the citylink on the other side of town. now this has been continuously prioritised by infrastructure australia. eastern suburbs residents desperately are calling for this and we have $4\u00a0billion on the table to get the project done. now that means that daniel andrews doesn't have to spend a cent in order to fulfil this project being built. so we're just pressing upon daniel andrews, let's at least update the business case and then get on with constructing the east west link. we have a very good working relationship with the andrews government on a whole raft of other projects across melbourne and across victoria. but this is the one project where we want him to say yes to the east west. question: and could it start further east as matthew guy proposed last year? alan tudge: we're open to all suggestions. i mean the critical thing is that you have a linkage from the end of the eastern freeway across to the western side of the city. the eastern freeway is one of the very few major freeways in australia now which comes to a full stop at the city rather than connecting up to another freeway on the other side of the city. so that's what is required. infrastructure australia has emphasised this in its report just this year. as i said, we respect the fact that daniel andrews doesn't want to put any money into that project. let us put the money in and let us get on with the job but he needs to give us the green light. question: do you think a new and updated business case could game over the line? alan tudge: well that's the obvious next step and we would encourage him to, it's the obvious next step and we would encourage him to at least consider updating the business case because then it can look at how it would align with the other major projects underway such as the north east link and the western distributor project and would also update all the financials underpinning it. but this is a project which needs to be built. as i said we're doing a lot of great projects together with the state government, we've got a great working relationship but we just want daniel andrews to say yes to east west.

alan tudge: no. not from me. absolutely not. but scott morrison did pretty well actually last night. i was impressed. and they\u2019re tough speeches and albo did pretty well as well. jon faine: so great bonhomie, is that what you\u2019re trying to tell us? alan tudge: these nights- it\u2019s the- i mean it is the one night of the parliamentary year where everybody does get together; they let their hair down a little bit because it\u2019s all for a good cause. it\u2019s raising money for charity and conducted by the press gallery. so it\u2019s always in good spirits. jon faine: yup. indeed, it is and that\u2019s a good thing. on family law, we were just talking to mr albanese a moment ago about it. do you think pauline hanson has shown bias even before the inquiry started? alan tudge: pauline hanson has had a very strong view in relation to family law issues for a long time and people know that. she will be the deputy chair of this inquiry. it\u2019ll be chaired though by kevin andrews and other members of the parliament on it.\nthey\u2019re going to be in a listening exercise largely for the next 12 months, which is understanding what the issues are that most concern people and then we\u2019ll formulate their recommendations having gone through that exercise. so it\u2019s a standard operating inquiry but looking at a really important issue which many people raise with elected members on a very regular basis. jon faine: but i asked if you thought she\u2019d demonstrated bias? alan tudge: it\u2019s an odd question. i mean we all come with our sets of values to this place and bring those to the table. but i would hope that through a committee process, everybody can just stop and listen to the evidence which was put before them and make conclusions based on the evidence. jon faine: the electoral commission of azerbaijan recently released the results of an election the day before the poll was held. we laugh at azerbaijan releasing the results of an election the day before it\u2019s held, but isn\u2019t pauline hanson announcing her views of family law reform before the inquiry she will be the deputy chair of has heard a single piece of evidence? alan tudge: well as i said, i hope that every single member of the committee will consider the evidence, and no doubt they\u2019ll hear gut wrenching evidence from the individual members of the public over the months ahead, and from that formulate some really constructive views. and particularly actually in relation to how the operational side of family law; how court orders can be better enforced; how we can keep legal costs down so that the families who are going through difficult periods can actually get their matters resolved cheaply, efficiently and can move on with their lives. jon faine: if you want to deal with those things, why don\u2019t you pick up the report that was done in the last parliament that\u2019s sitting on the shelf, while the report that\u2019s taken years prepared by no less an authority than the independent authoritative expert australian law reform commission that has 60 recommendations in its 500-page report, why not take notice of those before \u2026 alan tudge: oh, we will be taking- we will be taking notice of those and so that\u2019s only been released in april and we\u2019ll be responding in full to those recommendations. jon faine: so why just kick the can down the road to appease pauline hanson, who\u2019s already made her mind up anyway? alan tudge: i don\u2019t agree with that, jon. i mean this inquiry will complement the other pieces of work which have gone on. we\u2019ve done some substantial changes already in terms of merging the family law court with the federal circuit court, for example. and that will come into place shortly and this work will complement those other pieces of work. jon faine: your shadow minister- your shadow opponent catherine king in parliament yesterday accused you of sitting on your hands, said not one project from the urban congestion fund set up now more than a year ago, not any progress has been made they claim. what\u2019s your response? alan tudge: well i think there\u2019s a bit of politics there. this is what we announced just before the election in terms of 166 smaller scale projects around the country, really addressing those localised congestion hotspots, and we\u2019ve got work underway on every single one of them and construction will begin on the first before christmas. so we\u2019re getting on with the job. we\u2019ve got good relationships with the state governments. they want to work with us to get these projects done and we certainly want to see them done as quickly as possible. jon faine: and if indeed josh frydenberg makes an announcement at 10:30 about the budget update that confirms the nods, the winks and the smiles from senior figures in the government in anticipation of that announcement, should that- does that increase pressure on you and your colleagues to concede that newstart could rise, should rise and now has to rise? alan tudge: oh, that\u2019s not part of our plan and the prime minister has indicated that. i mean what the treasurer will be updating today is in relation to the financial figures for last financial year. and we had forecasts that we\u2019d be in deficit last financial year by $5.2 billion but the figures are coming in more strongly than that, largely because we\u2019ve got more people into work and there\u2019s a higher participation rate. and of course, when that happens, people go from being a net recipient of taxes to a net contributor of taxes and that obviously helps the budget overall. so good news it will be today. i\u2019m looking forward to hearing the results. jon faine: how come the mid-winter ball is in spring? lan tudge: you\u2019d have to ask the press gallery organisers that. jon faine: [laughs] alan tudge: but it\u2019s probably something to do with the fact that we had the election and then, you know, getting everyone sworn in and all that sort of thing. but it was, i didn\u2019t see you there actually, jon. jon faine: no. i didn\u2019t get an invitation. alan tudge: you didn\u2019t get an- oh, i\u2019m sorry about that. jon faine: the abc alan tudge: i\u2019ll see if i can organise one for next year\u2026 jon faine: the abc chair and managing director put a table together and quite rightly, virginia trioli was invited to attend, frocked up as only virginia can and i\u2019m sure she made a much more elegant contribution to the room than i ever could. alan tudge: there was about three or four tables from the abc though, jon. and they each had like 10 or 15 members on each table. jon faine: really? alan tudge: so you must have been like sixty-first on the list. jon faine: [laughs] alan tudge: i\u2019m sure if they had that extra table, you would\u2019ve been there. jon faine: well. alan tudge: i\u2019ll work on it for you next year. jon faine: well i will be- what am i?

"], "infrastructure-association-queensland-luncheon": ["06 September 2019", "thank you patrick (condren, mc) for your introduction. it\u2019s great to be here today. as i look around the room i can see some familiar faces, many of who i met with only two weeks ago to discuss the very exciting south east queensland city deal. the election of the morrison government means some of the approaches we have championed \u2013 such as our ten-year infrastructure investment pipeline and our commitment to city deals \u2013 are able to reset the approach to infrastructure policy in australia. these two initiatives will frame my remarks to you today. there can be no doubt that expenditure on infrastructure makes a vital contribution to supporting economic growth in this country. the governor of the reserve bank of australia emphasised this point last month when he said: \u2018spending on infrastructure not only adds to demand in the economy but, done properly, it can boost the economy's productivity. it can also directly improve the quality of people's lives through reducing congestion and improving services. congestion affects us all in one way or another. for those who face traffic every day, it takes valuable time away that could be spent with family and friends, or at work. to businesses reliant on getting across cities rapidly, it is an added cost. and to all australians, congestion it is a drain on the economy. avoidable congestion across our capital cities now costs $25 billion per year. without any policy change, this is predicted to rise to as much as $40 billion per year by 2030. over the past decade, our freeways have slowed, trains have become fuller, and many people in our community are concerned that it will only get worse. brisbane\u2019s share of this avoidable cost of congestion is currently $4 billion per year. this cost is projected to increase to more than $6 billion per year by 2030. congestion, of course, is largely a function of a simple equation: rapid population growth and infrastructure not keeping pace. we are working on both fronts to take action. on the population side of the equation, we are putting in place policies to ease the population pressures on our big capitals of melbourne, sydney and brisbane. these cities have been growing very fast by historic and international standards and account for 75% of australia\u2019s population growth in recent years. our population plan consists of reducing the migration rate (which constitutes 60 percent of australia\u2019s population growth) and encouraging more new arrivals to our smaller cities and regions, which are crying out for more people. on top of this, we have outlined a fast rail plan to connect our regional cities to our big capitals, with $2 billion to get the first fast rail project going \u2013 melbourne to geelong.\u00a0 this will allow people to live in those centres (and enjoy the cheaper housing and regional lifestyle) while still being able to access the big employment markets easily and simply on a daily basis. this works in conjunction with our migration changes to take population pressure off the big cities. the other side of the equation is infrastructure. as i have mentioned, the government has massively increased its infrastructure expenditure since it came to office. in 2014, we outlined a $50 billion infrastructure plan which was recognised at the time as the biggest in australian political history. earlier this year, we boosted the infrastructure expenditure to $100 billion. a third of the 900 major projects that we have announced since coming to office have been announced in the last 6 months alone. in the 2018-19 budget, we first committed ourselves to \u2018a credible, decade-long infrastructure investment pipeline of projects.\u2019 our embrace of a \u2018pipeline of projects\u2019 is a step-change in commonwealth processes. it acknowledges the obvious \u2013 that some major city-shaping, or even nation-shaping projects, have longer construction times than the standard four-year forward estimates period of a budget.\u00a0 completion of the melbourne to brisbane inland rail, for example, is expected in 2025, and the western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport in 2026, although construction of both is well underway. of course, we still strictly adhere to the normal fiscal discipline of budget practice, but we want to provide certainty around that pipeline of projects because the feedback from industry, in fact many of you in this very room, has been that you need certainty of this future pipeline. we are committed to delivering that. our government has committed over $25 billion to infrastructure in queensland since coming to government in 2013, with over $16 billion of that to be delivered over the next ten years of our forward pipeline. another element of our disciplined approach is to have infrastructure australia assess business cases for all projects where we are expected to contribute $100 million or more. in july this year, infrastructure australia completed their assessments of the business cases for three queensland projects: two on the m1 pacific motorway and one on the bruce highway.\u00a0 of these: the australian government has invested nearly $1.8 billion to bust congestion and improve efficiency along the m1 pacific motorway. we are also delivering major upgrades to reduce congestion, improve safety and increase flood immunity on the bruce highway, through a $10 billion upgrade program. of course, these are just some of the many transport infrastructure projects that we\u2019re investing in and construction is underway on a range of queensland projects as we speak. within the 2019-20 budget and the election campaign, we also committed funds to projects relating to the gateway motorway, the gladstone port access road extension, the cairns ring road and stage 5 of the townsville ring road. we have committed over $1 billion to queensland under the roads of strategic importance initiative to upgrade key commuter and freight corridors which benefit regional communities and industries. we have already committed $888 million towards upgrades of the warrego highway corridor between ipswich and roma. at the other end of the scale, our government has committed over $593 million across 30 congestion-busting infrastructure projects in queensland, through the urban congestion fund. these projects tackle pinch points on urban roads, like interchange upgrades and improved safety features on the gympie arterial road north of brisbane. we are also funding commuter car parks to get more people off the roads and onto public transport, including at beenleigh, ferny grove and mango hill stations. we have also committed $112 million towards gold coast light rail stage 3a, involving the extension from broadbeach south to burleigh heads, building on our earlier commitment of $95 million to stage 2. a greater willingness to invest in business cases is another hallmark of our government\u2019s approach. we have established a major project business case fund for this purpose, committing $78 million towards eight business case studies in queensland, so far. these include investigating options for passenger rail services from brisbane to toowoomba and for faster passenger rail services from brisbane to the gold coast.\u00a0 previously, we had committed funds under the faster rail prospectus initiative to explore fast rail options for brisbane to the regions of moreton bay and the sunshine coast. and subsequently committed $390 million to deliver the beerburrum to nambour rail upgrade. to coordinate our investment in fast rail projects, and advise on future opportunities, we have established a national faster rail agency, which will be supported by an expert panel. taken together, these fast rail measures are indicative of our willingness to explore a \u201845-minute region\u2019 for south-east queensland, which is the very first point cited in the statement of intent for a city deal.\u00a0 speaking of city deals, i was here just two weeks ago, engaging with some of our key stakeholders \u2013 many of you who are in this room today, along with councils and state government for the south east queensland city deal. yesterday we were in logan and moreton bay and this morning i was on the sunshine coast meeting with lots of the local industry representatives. it\u2019s a really rewarding feeling having everyone come together and make plans for the future of a city \u2013 there\u2019s nothing like it. our cities agenda has established the use of city deals as a way to deliver place-based policy for our cities. they are providing great opportunities around australia, building stronger, better and more liveable cities. queenslanders are more aware of this than most, given our very first city deal was in townsville, in 2016. three years on, we are collaborating successfully across the three levels of government to deliver on the townsville city deal; a 15-year agreement which is set to transform the city\u2019s economy and central business district. an example of this is the north queensland stadium, which is due for completion early next year. this project alone created around 2,000 local jobs, with more than 80% of the construction hours delivered by local subcontractors. this has had flow on impacts and contributed to a 3% reduction in the unemployment rate in townsville since we signed the deal. and of course this will also provide, ongoing employment for the region when completed. from february of next year, north queenslanders will be able to attend concerts, watch rugby games and other sporting matches. this stadium will be a mecca for entertainment and provide further opportunities to attract major events to north queensland, boosting tourism for the area and bolstering the local economy. this is just one example of the delivery elements in a city deal, the impacts of which are positively impacting the community. since townsville, i am very proud to say that the city deal model has been rolled out to launceston, western sydney, darwin, hobart, geelong and adelaide. in addition to south east queensland, which i will discuss in a moment, we are engaging with both perth and melbourne on city deals there. city deals can, and do, address the priorities of local communities. they are informed by conversations within communities about the type of city or region they want to live and work in. they require genuine engagement from the commonwealth, state, territory and local governments to maximise investment and achieve national priorities. they are time and resource concentrated, but that effort by all levels of government can, and does, achieve great outcomes. the statement of intent, signed in march this year, outlined a shared 20-year vision for a south east queensland city deal. the statement of intent covers six key themes: connecting infrastructure; jobs and skills; liveability and sustainability; housing and planning; digital; and governance and leadership. as you probably know, in the year to june 2018, nearly 90 per cent of queensland\u2019s population growth occurred in seq. the city deal will allow the three levels of government to work collaboratively across multiple agencies, and with the community, as well as the private and public sectors, to map out a joint, long-term plan to successfully manage the challenges posed by south east queensland\u2019s population growth. city deals help coordinate government action across departments within a single level, just as much as they do across three levels of government. under the \u2018connecting infrastructure\u2019 badge, the seq city deal will see the three levels of government agree on the infrastructure investment priorities. we will also work together to build on the existing investments already planned for the region, to ensure these achieve maximum business and community benefits. three of these are cited in the statement of intent: inland rail\u2019s benefits will be amplified by creating an economic corridor from toowoomba to brisbane to support economic development and jobs growth. there\u2019s a great deal of economic activity already happening in anticipation of the inland rail, particularly in sectors such as agribusiness and freight and logistics. through the city deal, the three levels of government can make sure we\u2019re reducing the barriers to this business activity, and communicating the opportunities for investment to industry, to ensure this infrastructure delivers on its region-shaping promise. i am confident that throughout the seq city deal, we will see all three deal partners engaging regularly with the private sector and community to make sure our shared plan for the region is clearly communicated. this will both boost business confidence and ensure we\u2019re maximising the opportunities for private sector investment and the innovative financing of projects. i also want to acknowledge today, your association\u2019s long and strong advocacy for an ambitious seq city deal. our largest deal to date \u2013 western sydney \u2013 involves eight local councils. the seq deal will involve ten. among them are five of the largest councils in australia. so, the scale of our ambitions for south east queensland are obvious. of course, all those involved need to work through the issues methodically, if we are to ensure this city deal will be fit for purpose for twenty years. i mentioned earlier that i was here just a few weeks ago for very a constructive discussion with the deputy premier and the chair of the council of mayors on the next steps for this deal, and i would like to thank your ceo, priscilla, for her valuable contributions at the industry roundtable the deal partners held that day. we will be holding more discussions with community and industry here in the region over the coming weeks, as we work towards developing the deal by mid-2020. i am excited about what we can achieve \u2013 working together. i want to thank the infrastructure association of queensland for the opportunity to speak here today. queenslanders played a significant role in the return of the government. this will give longevity to key elements of our current approach \u2013 like our ten-year infrastructure investment pipeline, increased funding for business cases for major project proposals, and the development of city deals. we have made a record $100 billion commitment to transport infrastructure. we have seven city deals in place, with three more on the way. i look forward, as you do, to finalising the south east queensland city deal and then getting on with its delivery. thank you for listening. "], "transcript-abc-radio-melbourne-interview-jon-faine": ["04 September 2019", "jon faine:yesterday the premier, who joins us shortly, was talking about expanding and taking the next step for the outer suburban rail loop. today the prime minister swans into town and together with state government ministers will announce the expansion of the monash in the south east of melbourne between warrigal road and out towards koo wee rup. alan tudge is one of the principal beneficiaries of this announcement as the federal government\u2019s minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population and also a man whose marginal electorate will be impacted by these announcements. mr tudge good morning to you. alan tudge: good morning jon. jon faine: do you enjoy watching utopia? alan tudge: you must have got out of bed on the wrong side today jon, you\u2019re so cynical to start the day. jon faine: do you enjoy watching utopia? alan tudge: this will make a real difference to people\u2019s lives in the south east of melbourne and it will save them time, if they\u2019re going to and from pakenham, save them about 22 minutes every single day. so that\u2019s real, tangible difference to people\u2019s lives. jon faine: how long will the construction phase go for? because that\u2019s going to cause further congestion in a city that is almost choking on road works as we speak. alan tudge: so, this will start early next year and finish in late 2022 and most of the work here is in two sections. one between warrigal road and east link, and the other from clyde road to cardinia road, both on the monash freeway. and for anyone who knows the monash it\u2019s a tremendously busy road, the growth has been enormous down the south east corridor and this is going to add additional capacity to the monash. jon faine: at the same time, we\u2019re spending some money on rail and alternatives in public transport, but not out that far. would it not make more sense to extend and expand the rail system past the outer south east instead of building a bigger and bigger freeway? alan tudge: well yeah, you have to do both, it\u2019s not either or here, but most people certainly are still taking their cars. and, they\u2019ve just had, we\u2019ve just had tremendous growth down the south east, the traffic volumes have been increasing by over 4 per cent per annum over the last decade so you do have to continue to build the infrastructure there. some parts of the monash are only two lanes each way and so this project is adding an extra lane each way to that. jon faine: and that\u2019s vital to relieve some of those bottle necks. alan tudge: that\u2019s vital to relieve the bottle necks. it\u2019s also vital for freight. jon faine: you would be about the fiftieth minister in my years in this job, i don\u2019t know how many times i\u2019ve interviewed state and federal ministers who have promised that just this little bit more will solve all the problems, this will ease the congestion, this will result in travel times being saved. none of which ever turns out to be true. alan tudge: again jon, i don\u2019t agree with your assertions there. we constantly need to be building infrastructure to keep up with the population growth. now, melbourne is the fastest growing big city in australia and we\u2019ve got a population plan to ease the pressure on our big cities of melbourne and sydney and try to create further growth in some of the smaller cities and the regional areas which are crying out for more people. we\u2019ve also pulled back on the immigration rate which slows down the population growth nationally as well. so that\u2019s on the one hand. but on the other hand we do have to continue to invest in infrastructure such as the monash, such as additional rail capacity and i know the premier\u2019s going to be talking about the suburban rail loop. we want to get the rowville rail going and have got money on the table there. we\u2019ve obviously got money to get the monash airport rail going, $5 billion dollars. let\u2019s get fast rail out to geelong, we\u2019ve got $2 billion there. so we\u2019ve got to do this infrastructure, rail and road, while also managing the population better as well. jon faine: is this designed to provide some economic stimulus because nothing else, including your much vaunted tax cuts that your prime minister promised, that\u2019s not worked. so is this some way to what, build our way to a stronger economy? alan tudge: well, let\u2019s wait and see before you make a conclusion that it hasn\u2019t worked. so tomorrow we\u2019ll have the second quarter results come out and that\u2019s obviously\u2026 jon faine: no. the gdp figures are out at 11:30 today. alan tudge: sorry, they come out today and that\u2019s based on the second quarter of this year and so, of this calendar year, so that\u2019s before the tax cuts have really kicked in and before there\u2019s been additional interest rate drops as well. and that quarter obviously incorporates the fact that we had an election and that people were expecting a labor victory and so had built in, i think, a number of extra taxes which would have slowed down the economy. jon faine: economic growth seems to have, well it may not have stalled but certainly it\u2019s slowed down. so you didn\u2019t answer my question, is this principally designed to prime the pump, to create jobs and economic activity? it\u2019s part of the government\u2019s economic rescue package, is that part of what motivates this? alan tudge: so this project has obviously been planned for some years and the construction will begin though very shortly, and we\u2019re putting in some additional money to really get it going. now of course infrastructure is a great mechanism for supporting economic growth, both in the short term as well as the medium and long term. in the short term this project, for example, will generate 600 jobs. in the medium term, once the project is completed, you\u2019re adding additional productive capacity to the economy overall because the trucks can move more quickly, people can get around more rapidly, the freight can move and obviously that supports the economic growth as well. jon faine: and nine minutes, where does the nine minutes shaved off travel time? did someone just make that up in some sort of strategy meeting? alan tudge: you have been watching too much utopia i think jon. no these are, for every single project which is done of major proportions, and this is a billion-dollar project, there is modelling done and there\u2019s estimates made about what the time savings will be. so it\u2019ll be nine minutes\u2019 savings on the inbound traffic if you\u2019re coming from pakenham, and about 13 minutes on the way out. jon faine: you mean not at peak hour? alan tudge: no these are at peak hour, these are at peak hour. i mean, if you\u2019re not travelling in peak hour\u2026 jon faine: at peak hour it crawls. alan tudge: if you\u2019re not travelling at peak hour you can still relatively easily get through on the monash, but at peak hour it\u2019s really congested. and i\u2019ll tell you where a really congested place is and that\u2019s actually further out, and which is where our focus is in this particular project. jon faine: out towards pakenham? alan tudge: it\u2019s out towards berwick and pakenham because that\u2019s where its only two lanes each way. so we\u2019re adding additional lanes that go there. jon faine: yeah, and that\u2019s ridiculous too. minister, why not put tolls on so that you recover some of the revenue that\u2019s being spent, some of the funds that have been expended in order to roll them into the next project? as you just said you need to keep building further and further out so why not put a toll on? alan tudge: so we\u2019re not tolling the road here, that\u2019s not part of the plan. jon faine: sure, but why not? alan tudge: this has been a toll free road for some time, there\u2019s obviously tolls on the monash further in, so this project is being done on a toll free basis. jon faine: yeah, but why? alan tudge: well, in this particular instance we\u2019ve got sufficient government funding to be able to do the work, it\u2019s a billion-dollar project with the very large-scale projects such as north east link and even the east link, obviously there was tolls put on that to help recover some of the costs. we want to keep the cost down to its minimum. at the end of the day, the toll decisions are actually made by the state government, not by the federal government. jon faine: sure, they are. but what we\u2019ve got here and you\u2019re part and parcel of the planning, we\u2019ve now got some roads that are tolled and some that aren\u2019t. depending on where you live, you either win or lose in the lottery, the tolling lottery, and your commute is either incredibly expensive or completely subsidised by the taxpayer. wouldn\u2019t it be fairer if all these road projects included the introduction of a toll, it doesn\u2019t have to be a large one, but then at least you take away that lottery? alan tudge: certainly i wouldn\u2019t want to see a toll on that part of the monash, but that\u2019s a question that\u2019s better put to the premier who i understand you\u2019ve got on after me. jon faine: yeah, i thought you believed in user pays. alan tudge: again, on this part of the road, you\u2019ve only got two lanes each way on parts of the monash, despite having tremendous growth down berwick-pakenham corridor, and that\u2019s an area i know well having grown up in pakenham. so we want to alleviate the congestion pressures for those people, widen the roads there. but if you\u2019ve got questions about tolls, i think they\u2019re better put to the premier. jon faine: all right. well i\u2019ll get the chance to do so in a moment. did you enjoy your fundraiser dinner at the television station run by nine media the other night? alan tudge: it was another fundraising dinner which i attended and unfortunately, well not unfortunately, part of our role is having to raise funds for our campaigns later when it comes around to election time. jon faine: do you think it\u2019s appropriate that politicians raise funds inside a tv station, inside a studio run by what\u2019s supposed to be an independent news reporting organisation? alan tudge: well that\u2019s a decision of nine to host that. they hosted the venue only, and obviously all the guests there were from right across australia who were willing to come and support the liberal party in this instance. but political parties are constantly having fundraising events because campaigns are expensive. and that\u2019s just part of the australian democracy and if people want to contribute to a political party, of course, they\u2019re entitled to do so. jon faine: what would you say if a media outlet hosted a fundraiser for the greens who are not your favourites or the labor party? you\u2019d cry foul, wouldn\u2019t you? alan tudge: well, i mean, as the head of nine actually said, they\u2019re willing to host functions for both political parties\u2026 jon faine: yeah, they\u2019re willing to, they just haven\u2019t done it. alan tudge: well again, they\u2019re questions for the nine ceo, not for me. jon faine: no, but are you comfortable with attending and being used, effectively used in that way? alan tudge: what do you mean by effectively used? jon faine: well, there\u2019s a media outlet cuddling up to a government that it\u2019s supposed to be at an arm\u2019s length from and you\u2019re a participant in all of that. shouldn\u2019t politicians and media outlets, at least if they want to be taken seriously, shouldn\u2019t they at all times be at arm\u2019s length? alan tudge: well i think, i mean, many businesses and many different organisations host fundraisers for political parties and that\u2019s what occurred earlier this week, in this instance, by nine. but i\u2019ve attended fundraisers at all sorts of different organisations and i\u2019m sure that will continue, jon. jon faine: all right. well thank you indeed for answering all my impertinent questions, alan tudge there. alan tudge: thank you jon. i hope you have a better day today. jon faine: i\u2019m having a fabulous day. in fact, it\u2019s got off to a great start from my point of you. minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population in scott morrison\u2019s federal coalition government.

phillip thompson said the number of seats in the stadium will make it well suited to hosting blockbuster events like the queensland derby. \u201cthe new stadium will have 25,000 seats, which is 7,000 more than at the 1300smiles stadium. that means 7,000 more people will be able to get a seat to watch big matches like the cowboys versus the broncos,\u201d mr thompson said. townsville mayor jenny hill said fans and visitors will have no doubt where they were thanks to the north queensland stadium\u2019s iconic design. \u201cwhether you\u2019re inside or out the pandanus theme continues throughout the stadium as seating is distributed in an angular pattern that complements the stadium\u2019s spectacular roof.\u201d director adam fisher said his company continues to work closely with allunga exposure laboratory, located just outside of townsville, to test all materials it places in external \u00a0environments. allunga understands the toll that the strong queensland sun can take on outdoor fixtures, so it makes sense to partner with them for our testing,\u201d he said. \u201cthese seats are renowned for their comfort and we\u2019re proud to be bringing this high-quality product to the stadium, in customised colours and arrangement.\u201d the north queensland stadium project is a joint project of the queensland government, australian government and townsville city council and is supported by both the nrl and the north queensland cowboys. the stadium forms part of the townsville city deal signed in december 2016. fast facts: "],

(nancy-bird walton) airport with the morrison government signing off on a key earthworks contract. after a rigorous competitive tender process, the contract, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, will go to lend lease cpb, who will undertake one of australia\u2019s largest ever infrastructure earthworks projects. prime minister scott morrison said work under the contract would move around 25 million cubic metres of earth on the site to support construction of the major elements of the airport, including the runway and terminal. \u201cwith the ink now signed on the contacts, this huge construction work is due to begin in early 2020, and it\u2019ll mean hundreds of new jobs on the airport site,\u201d the prime minister said.\u00a0 \u201cthis is a game-changer for western sydney and things are starting to take shape. \u201cthe airport is going to mean more jobs for local workers and more opportunities for western sydney.\u201d the award of this contract is another major milestone in the delivery of the federally funded, $5.3 billion western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport. deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development michael mccormack said this was an important first step in the construction of a once-in-a-lifetime infrastructure project. \u201cthe construction of a major airport comes around once in a generation and this infrastructure project will not only provide job opportunities west of sydney during the construction phase but also beyond 2026 when it opens,\u201d the deputy prime minister said.\u00a0 \u201cwhen complete, the western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport will ensure greater connectivity to other australian cities, regional hubs and of course the world which benefits all australians and visitors.\u201d finance minister mathias cormann said that in reaching this next milestone the project was entering an exciting new phase. \u201csince early earthworks started in september 2018, more than 1.5 million cubic metres of earth has been moved,\u201d minister cormann said. \u201cbut construction activity has so far only concentrated on a small portion of the 1,780 hectare site. \u201cwith the awarding of this contract, we will see work on the site ramp up significantly. the contractors will soon be working across an area of around 1,000\u00a0hectares, leading to greater progress and more jobs. minister for population cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the contract was one of the most significant steps in the delivery of the airport, which is due to open for business in 2026.\u00a0 \u201cwe are keeping our promise to not only deliver a world-class airport for western sydney, but to turbo charge the transformation of the region,\u201d minister tudge said. \u201cstemming from the airport, the western sydney city deal is delivering jobs, investment and infrastructure for the region, with work underway on a range of projects.\u201d member for lindsay melissa mcintosh said she was committed to delivering infrastructure to ease congestion and create more local jobs in western sydney. \u201cthe airport, aerotropolis and science park alongside the western sydney city deal will create over 200,000 jobs and opportunities to train our local kids in the jobs of the future,\u201d ms mcintosh said.

"], "technology-and-congestion": ["28 August 2019", "thank you dean zabrieszach for the introduction. may i start by expressing my appreciation for the day-to-day work of its australia, and in particular for organising this summit. each year, the its summit brings together australian leaders in transport technology to share information, learn from each other and work out opportunities to make our transport networks safer, more efficient and sustainable. melbourne is an excellent choice as the location for 2019. it is our fastest growing major city and this is creating immense challenges for our roads and transport systems that require smart responses. the challenges in melbourne are replicated to a large or smaller extent in our other big cities\u2014faster growing populations putting pressure on our infrastructure and slowing our cities down. congestion affects us all in some capacity. for those who face the traffic every day, t takes valuable time away from family and friends. for businesses reliant on getting across cities rapidly, it is an added cost. but to all australians, it is a drain on the economy. avoidable congestion across our capital cities now costs $25\u00a0billion per year. without any policy change, this is predicted to rise to as much as $40\u00a0billion per year by 2030. over the last decade, the freeways have slowed, the trains have become fuller, and many are concerned that it will only get worse. today, at this intelligent transport systems summit, i want to discuss how we at the federal government are thinking about these congestion challenges and, in particular how we see technology as being part of the solution. congestion, of course, is largely a function of a simple equation: rapid population growth and infrastructure not keeping pace. we are working on both fronts. on the population side of the equation, we are putting in place policies to ease the population pressures on our big capitals of melbourne, sydney and brisbane. these cities have been growing very fast by historic and international standards and account for 75% of australia's population growth in recent years. our population plan consists of reducing the migration rate (which constitutes 60 percent of australia's population growth) and encouraging more new arrivals to our smaller cities and regions that need more people. on top of this, we have outlined a fast rail plan to connect the satellite cities to our big capitals, with $2\u00a0billion to get the first one going\u2014melbourne to geelong.\u00a0 this will allow people to live in those centres (and enjoy the cheaper housing and regional lifestyle) while still being able to access the big employment markets easily and simply on a daily basis. this works in conjunction with the migration changes to take population pressure off the big cities. the other side of the equation is infrastructure. the government has massively increased its infrastructure expenditure since it came to office. in 2014, we outlined a $50\u00a0billion infrastructure plan which was recognised at the time as the biggest in australian political history. early this year, we boosted the infrastructure expenditure to $100\u00a0billion. a third of the 900 major projects that we have announced since coming to office have been announced in the last 6 months alone. a significant proportion of the government's investment is building the high capacity transport solutions we need to serve our growing cities. this includes major projects such as westconnex in sydney, the monash freeway upgrades, m80 upgrades and airport rail in melbourne and the gateway and ipswich motorways in brisbane. right now, there are 160 major projects underway that we are funding with a further 120 in the planning. we will continue to invest in transport infrastructure in the years ahead to boost the overall installed capacity of our road, rail and other transport networks. there is an opportunity, however, to get more out of existing and future infrastructure through the use of technology. this can provide immense congestion busting benefits, but at a fraction of the cost of building new capacity\u2014the government wants to explore more of this. there are at least three ways that technology is already doing this or soon will and where the government is investing. first, technology can help with getting better utilisation of the hundreds of billions of dollars of existing road and rail assets. even a small improvement in capacity utilisation of existing roads and rail can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. one way where australia has been a leader in doing this has been in intelligent transport systems. intelligent transport system solutions\u2014such as ramp metering, dynamic speed limits, reversible lanes, variable signage and traffic signal priority for emergency and freight vehicles\u2014can massively increase road utilisation and hence, effective capacity. the kwinana smart freeway system in perth is a great example of this. costing $47\u00a0million (of which the australian government is contributing $38\u00a0million), the project is expected to boost the freeway capacity by 33 percent through coordinated ramp signals, all-lane running through a lane management system, variable speed limits and an upgraded driver information system. if we were to boost the capacity of that freeway by the 33 percent by building new lanes, the cost would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. the government has made similar investments on the bruce highway\u2014the latest being a commitment of up to $84\u00a0million towards the $105\u00a0million managed motorway project between gateway motorway and the caloundra road interchange. we expect these upgrades to reduce peak hour travel times by around 30 per cent\u2014saving queensland commuters nearly 14\u00a0million hours of travel time by 2031. that project carries a benefit cost ratio exceeding 9:1. that is the kind of value for money that technology can provide that no straight up infrastructure project can. we want to do more of this. while intelligent transport systems are available now, in the future, automated vehicles will potentially provide a further step-change increase in the utilisation of existing road assets and hence help reduce congestion. modelling from the federal bureau of infrastructure, transport and regional economics indicates that by 2030, congestion costs would drop by more than a quarter if automated vehicles account for 30 per cent of kilometres travelled, which they call a \u201cfast penetration scenario\u201d. how does this work? there are several ways that automated vehicles can increase road utilisation and hence reduce congestion, but the main one is that it would allow cars to safely travel more closely together. zoox, one of the leading automated vehicle providers in the united states, estimates that when you analyse a freeway the moment before it begins experiencing congestion (that is, the moment before the traffic slows below the road's regulated speed), the vehicles only occupy about 8 percent of the bitumen. ninety two percent of the freeway is not occupied, but is necessary for driver safety. if that 8 percent figure was doubled through precise sensing and automation, then you are effectively doubling the freeway capacity. we are preparing for this possible future of automated vehicles through the transport and infrastructure council and our creation of the office of future transport technologies. you will be hearing from the general manager of this office later this morning. the second way that technology can help with addressing congestion is through providing better consumer information. no doubt a number of people used google maps to determine the optimal route to come to this conference.\u00a0 this is real time data informing people how to optimise their route. in the future, we will no doubt have more predictive congestion data as well.\u00a0 that is, someone will be able to determine whether it is best to wait until 9am to travel versus trying to leave at 8:30 and will be able to accurately assess the time taken in each scenario.\u00a0 such development may be funded by private sector or government. through our $50\u00a0million smart cities program, we are funding a number of projects to assist with smart parking. in essence, providing real time information as to where carparks are located. why is this important? because according to some studies, drivers looking for parking may account for up to 30 percent of inner-urban traffic.\u00a0 if we can reduce this figure by even a fraction, we can make a significant impact. government's opening up their data can also lead to an explosion of innovative solutions and partnerships with industry. it is exciting to see transport for new south wales and uber partner to bring public transport options to the uber app. this is about giving commuters options and information to plan their trips, and encourage more people to use transit and reduce road congestion. the new south wales government is currently trialing an on-demand bus service. this is a flexible service, which allows people to book a vehicle via an online app or over the phone, from their home or a nearby location such as a shopping centre or hospital, taking them to a local transport hub or landmark. the cost is comparable to a one-way bus ticket and it allows people to access public transport when and where they need it, improving connectivity to the existing public transport network. the final way that that technology can assist with addressing congestion is through the development of cheaper and innovative transport solutions. some of these new transport solution will be developed and implemented by the private sector such as the rollout of electric scooters and electric bikes in cities around australia. others, however, will require the support of government to make them operational. governments across australia should be open to these new technologies so that we can get more value from the dollars invested. trackless trams, for example, have entered the discussion about australia's infrastructure future. this conversation comes from the recognition that delivering mass transit infrastructure in our denser urban environments comes at high cost, with often significant disruption to the network during construction. emerging examples seen in china replicate the benefits of a traditional tram or light rail system\u2014speeds, ride quality, level-entry for passengers and multiple doors for entry and exit. the promise of the system is the replacement of the steel rail with optical guidance. in a sense moving from physical to digital tracks. this means it can be installed with much less disruption to a network, and with significant cost savings, potentially costing $6\u20138\u00a0million per kilometre compared to $50\u00a0million or more for existing light rail systems. \u00a0 i have only scratched the surface of what transport technologies mean for our cities and the infrastructure that keeps them moving. and keeping them moving is fundamental to my role as minister. large cities will always have some level of congestion, but i look to industry and the professionals here today for additional solutions to the avoidable congestion that prevents the network from working to its best. while we look ahead and plan for the new technologies that could transform the sector, we are actively investing in the proven technologies of today. the australian government's record investment in transport infrastructure can only benefit from better utilisation and better services and management made available through technology. i would like to thank its australia again for organising the event and bringing together the expertise in the room today, including many of our international partners who are contributing their knowledge. government is ready to work together with industry on our commitment to tackle congestion and deliver the best infrastructure for australians. "], "doorstop-launceston": ["26 August 2019", "albert van zetten: i want to welcome you all here and thank you indeed for coming and there's quite a number of people that have come to support what is a very significant day in our city. the city deal has been so important already. we're now two years in and it's something that we're very pleased about, and obviously with the federal government and the state government to do the extension, it's been extremely important for us as a city. i'm pleased to welcome today the honourable alan tudge, who is the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure and also to welcome the minister for state growth, michael ferguson and bridget archer is here with us as well and the honourable rosemary armitage, i\u2019ve seen, and quite a few other people are with us supporting, especially people from the university structure. i think it's so important that they are here. the city deal, as we know, has been probably in the workings now for some three to four years. we committed two years ago into signing, and since that time, a number of projects have commenced already in our city. we've obviously seen the city heart project, which is part of the city deal, and we've seen the success of civic square, been absolutely fantastic for our city. a lot of the events bringing people into the city centre. we now know that the other events that or programs about to start the northern suburbs my place my future, which is extremely important for the northern suburbs. we also know that it's going to be starting with the tamar estuary, some money has been rolled out. there'll be more to be said about that later. so i'd now like to introduce the honourable alan tudge, who will speak further about the city deal. thank you. alan tudge: well, thank you very much to the mayor and it's also great to be here with the minister michael ferguson, i've known for a very long time, as well as of course our new member here who's just doing a fantastic job, bridget archer, along with the other state members of parliament. just over two years ago, we announced this city deal for launceston and it was a very significant deal with the vision of making launceston one of the most liveable and innovative regional cities in australia. two years in, we are delivering upon that vision. the document which we are releasing today is the annual progress report after two years of this deal being in operation. and you\u2019ll read through this annual progress report and you'll see that we have already achieved so much in terms of delivering for the people of launceston. i think the most visible part, as the mayor mentioned, is obviously the civic square and also the mall, which is being upgraded. but this document perhaps is the best snapshot which covers so many of the other elements as a highlight which have already been achieved. we've had an 88 per cent increase, for example, in the number of planning applications, constituting $211 million worth of investment since the deal was signed. over 12,000 individuals have been helped by the entrepreneur facilitator and that means there's going to be future small businesses created into the future. of course, we agreed just before the election that we would, at the federal level, put in an additional $55 million and extend this city deal by an extra five years as well because that provides more certainty for communities here in launceston. we\u2019ve had over 100 expressions of interest in the first round for the tamar action grants and that means we're going to be able to clean up the river and make sure we're looking after the river well into the future. of course there\u2019s so much more to go as well and most importantly, the relocation of the university and that planning is well underway. we'll see the sods being turned in the next six to 12 months, and if there's further details in relation to that, we've got professor rufus black from the university of tasmania is here as well, who can provide further comments in terms of those plans. but overall, this was a plan to make a liveable, innovative city. we're well on track at the two-year mark. we've got a lot more to do and i'm so pleased to be able to stand here with the mayor, with the state minister because ultimately, city deals are about the three levels of government working cooperatively, working together, to outline a long-term vision for a particular geographical area and that's exactly what is occurring here. the three of us working together, laying out a road map for the next 10 years and making this place an even better location than it already is today. michael ferguson: thank you, alan. it's fantastic to have you here in launceston and i'd also really like to acknowledge and pay respects to the mayor albert van zetten. on behalf of him and his councillors, together with my friend alan tudge, it's great to welcome you back to tasmania and celebrate the achievements that we've been able to work on and deliver for tasmanians and for the people of launceston; to my good friend and federal colleague, bridget archer; and i\u2019d also like to acknowledge my parliamentary colleague, rosemary armitage from the tasmanian parliament and as member for launceston with a particular interest in the deal. may i acknowledge also rufus black, who's become not just a tasmanian himself, but a great innovator in his own right and leading his team through a period of great transformation. and i'd also like to acknowledge briefly the office of the coordinator-general, john and his colleagues, who on behalf of tasmania have been working on implementing. we're very pleased today to be releasing the annual progress report for two years into our 10-year deal. we've actually converted the deal from a five-year to a 10. this gives greater longevity, greater certainty. it means that while the commitments made in the first five years will continue to be honoured, we've actually got a framework and a structure within which we can continue to work together between our three different levels of government into the future. we are delivering, the results are on the board as people walking through our city are able to see immediately. but there's a lot more contained within the pages of the progress report, where the local community are able to quickly see exactly what's being done and what's yet to occur. and if they're waiting for something and hoping for an achievable to be done, they'll also be able to see what work has been happening in the background between our three levels of government. i'm particularly thrilled that we are able to bring together a plan that's about making our city much more liveable, more enjoyable, a happier place for families to live, work, and invest, but also a place of jobs and employment opportunity, creating business, driving an entrepreneurial culture. making our city a smart city with traffic solutions that actually work. building the infrastructure that our growing city needs so we can reduce congestion. and, for example, make sure that using smart technology, our signalling system allows traffic to move more freely. there's so much more yet to come. but i want to make a particular fine point that the tasmanian community, and in particular launceston community, can be assured that these three levels of government are working together like never before. we're getting results, and there's a lot more yet to achieve, which we will focus on and with the achievements that have been reached already. we\u2019re particularly on this spot here mindful of the enormous work that\u2019s about to unfold with the university of tasmania transformation. this is a very, very significant project for our state and for our country. and where we're standing of course is in line with the three stage development, which will include a bridge over the north esk river here to our north. so this is a place of future vibrancy, and we particularly commend the university, not just for completing its precinct plan, but also now placing its development application with the launceston city council, which i'm sure going through its appropriate processes will nonetheless result in progress where we can see building works commencing in the coming year. thank you. alan tudge: thank you. happy to take any questions for any of us here, and the vice chancellor as well. journalist: what is being done to address the health of the tamar river as part of this city deal? albert van zetten: there's a progress of $94.5 million that has been set by the state and the federal government. out of that there's $10 million which is now in process for people to apply for to put fences up on properties to stop a lot of the animals getting close to the water so make an impact on the water. there's also work now being set up by us and the city of launceston and taswater, looking at the combined system and how we can divert some of the water from going through the combined system, especially in times of heavy rains and flooding. we're looking at catchment areas, so when there is again heavy rain and some of it would go through the combined system, that will be caught in the catchment areas, and it won't flow through. and on top of that, apart from all of those, taswater\u2019s also looking at upgrading their systems which would be hopefully a $300 million commitment in the next, what, three to five years. journalist: so has the health of the river improved at all yet? since the money\u2019s come into play? albert van zetten: it's about to start to improve. journalist: when you think that will happen? albert van zetten: look, it should start to happen. obviously with the $10 million that\u2019s rolled out now. and then the next lot of works get coordinated through taswater. and i'm not sure the exact timeline, but i would hope by within three to five years, we're going to see significant difference in our river. alan tudge: this is a huge investment in the river. $95 million all up, and the first $10 million is about to go as the mayor was saying. but then it's over the medium term as well that we would be making further investments to make sure this is as healthy as it possibly can be. albert van zetten: can i just add to that, though? i think the public can play a role already for today by not throwing their rubbish on to the ground, not throwing cigarette butts onto the ground, plastics. people just throw it and put it into the river. that\u2019s creating issues so if we cannot have that happening, we\u2019d be starting to clean it up already, then with the extra work, that\u2019s going to make a significant difference. journalist: as major investors in the university transformation project, are you happy with the progress so far? albert van zetten: obviously from my point of view, we'd love to see that done quicker. there's no doubt about that, but we're happy that we've come to a stage where it's going to be something that's meaningful, that's going to be relevant for launceston, and we\u2019re going to be able to work together to ensure it\u2019s the best for what our city and what our city needs. and i think that's important. rather than rushed into it and done it, it\u2019s obviously, changing staffing, has been sat down and they thought about it. now i think we\u2019ve got a model that can work into the future. alan tudge: this was one of the centrepieces of the city deal overall and the major funding commitments from the federal government was to move the university campus to its new location. now, the sods will start to begin to be turned this financial year, and we're going to see progress and the buildings completed by 2024. obviously the design\u2019s changed somewhat from what we initially envisaged, but it will be worth the wait, because at the end of the day, this will be brand new buildings going up there, just across the river, there\u2019s going to be up to 16,000 students and staff located there. they'll be able to walk across the bridge and then access the cbd. so you'll be bringing real life into the city centre as well. this has been a pattern across australia with city deals, where we've actually been supporting university campuses to get closer into the cbd because by doing that, you bring students, you bring life into the city centre. it makes them safer. it brings customers to the cafes and shops, and it overall adds to the amenity of the city. so it\u2019s a really exciting component in relation to it. rufus i don\u2019t know if you wanted to add further details in relation to the plans there. but we're ready to go, money\u2019s there, plans are developed, and we\u2019re looking forward to it starting. rufus black: it will be fantastic for launceston. i think we now have the right plan. development applications are in and we\u2019re looking forward to getting those buildings out of the ground. journalist: two years on from when this money was first promised, what assurances have been given to the state and federal government that the project will be on budget? alan tudge: absolutely the projects will be on budget. we\u2019ve got a set amount which we have allocated. i understand that actually in that time the vice-chancellor and university have been able to secure more private funding towards the projects as well. so it\u2019s underway and we want to see the building\u2019s occurring as the vice-chancellor said they\u2019re going to be happening very soon and it\u2019s going to make the university of tasmania fantastic here in launceston. journalist: and alan, how is the hobart city deal progressing? alan tudge: yeah, that\u2019s progressing well. i\u2019ll be catching up with the mayors tomorrow and we'll be discussing the implementation plan there. it's only six months since we actually announced the city deal in hobart just near the airport there and the implementation plan will soon be finalised, and we're releasing that very soon. journalist: when do you hope to have it finalised by? alan tudge: we're down to the final details now, so we'll be discussing this amongst the mayors and minister ferguson and myself tomorrow and then we\u2019ll be releasing it shortly afterwards. journalist: back to launceston, part of making the city deal is making the city more liveable. but with the negotiations breaking down with glebe farm, what are we looking at in terms of traffic solutions and parking? albert van zetten: glebe farm was only ever part of the traffic solution, so we\u2019re moving to other options that we\u2019ve always had on the table. with glebe farm, it\u2019s really important that commercial relationships work well so that we\u2019re spending public money wisely and appropriately. we\u2019ll never do a deal that isn\u2019t in the broad public interest, and we\u2019ve got lots of other options and it\u2019s fantastic working with the council in solving these kind of challenges. journalist: when can the people of launceston expect to see tangible results from this next phase of the city deal? alan tudge: well we\u2019ve already seen tangible results. i mean, you see that in the city square directly and we\u2019re about to go into the next phase as well. we\u2019re going to the next phase of cleaning up the river, we\u2019re moving the university campus as we\u2019ve been discussing, there\u2019s so many other elements which are going on. this is what was a five year plan, now we\u2019re extending it to being a 10 year plan. at the federal level we\u2019ve put in an extra $55 million, and that includes $15 million to develop a community hub in the northern suburbs and bridget archer was absolutely critical in securing that money and we want to get that underway shortly as well. i know there\u2019s been progress between the state governments and the local council over the parcel of lands there. so we\u2019re progressively going to see things roll out according to the implementation schedule which we\u2019ve outlined. we\u2019re largely on track here. there\u2019s some things which are a bit in front, couple of things a little bit behind, but over the next few years more and more will be rolled out.

"], "transcript-brisbane-doorstop": ["13 August 2019", "alan tudge: well, g\u2019day, it\u2019s great to be here in brisbane with the lord mayor adrian schrinner. we\u2019ve just had a terrific meeting discussing the 12 projects which we jointly have agreed to fund and construct in the years ahead. now, from the federal government\u2019s perspective those 12 projects equate to over $270 million worth of commitments, and on top that, of course, we have our $300 million commitments to the brisbane metro. we\u2019ve been working through each of those 12 projects one by one, working out what the issues are, what the timelines can be, and we can certainly confirm that every single one of those projects will be getting underway within the years ahead, and we\u2019ll be able to provide some precise details in the upcoming weeks. every single one of these 12 projects is designed to bust congestion here in brisbane. we jointly share this aspiration. and on top of the 12 projects that of course we\u2019re jointly funding, the lord mayor through the brisbane city council is funding all sorts of other projects as well. i know the lord mayor will be keen to talk about the coopers plains level crossing; it\u2019s one of the 12 projects, and we have $74 million- $73 million already committed from the federal perspective, and we certainly welcome the $40 million contribution, which the brisbane city council has announced today. and again, that will just be another great project which can be completed in the years ahead, and just make it safer and easier for people to get across that railway line and be able to get home sooner and safer. while i\u2019m here, can i also just make some comments in relation to the infrastructure audit- infrastructure australia audit which has been released today. now, infrastructure australia is a terrific independent body, and we always listen to the issues which they raise, and they inform our decision making. the issues which they raise in their report today particularly concern congestion in our major cities. now this is something that i have been talking about, the prime minister has been talking about, almost nonstop for the past 12 months. so we hear them very clearly in terms of the challenges in places like brisbane, sydney, and melbourne in particular. i would say though that the infrastructure australia audit was based on data from 12 months ago, so it doesn't incorporate the $23 billion worth of new projects that we have announced since that time. and it also doesn't incorporate the fact that we've introduced the new population policy, which has seen a reduction in the migration rates and seen new incentives for the people to be able to- new incentives for migrants to consider going to regional areas and smaller cities, as a way of taking pressure off our big capital cities of brisbane, sydney, and melbourne. overall though, it's a good report and we'll certainly be examining it very closely in the weeks ahead. part of our congestion plan, of course, is $100 billion of infrastructure which we're rolling out right across this country, including here in brisbane, but in our other capital cities and regions across australia as well. i\u2019ll hand it over to the lord mayor to make some comments as well, then we can handle any questions. adrian schrinner: it is fantastic to have a federal government that is committed to building infrastructure. what we're seeing right now is the largest commitment by any federal government into brisbane infrastructure. we've got more than $500 million of investment by this federal government into brisbane, including brisbane metro, and including a dozen projects that were referred to before. that is the largest investment that any federal government has ever made into brisbane, and that will benefit brisbane residents massively. congestion is a critical issue across our city, and it is great to have this cooperative working relationship with the federal government, where they\u2019re not only working with us, but putting real dollars on the table to build projects across the city. now we see brisbane metro rolling out with federal support, and we will see these dozen or more projects rolling out in the coming years that will benefit brisbane residents right across the city and suburbs; projects like indooroopilly roundabout that they've committed to, projects like rochdale priestdale road intersection. right across the city there are projects that we are working on together to make sure residents can get home sooner and safer. alan tudge: any questions? question: what was that a criticism then, you know, election- government\u2019s only think in election cycles rather than long term plan? alan tudge:: well, to the contrary, we\u2019ve actually outlined a ten-year pipeline of projects, constituting $100 billion. and that works in conjunction with our population plan as well, which is taking real measures to reduce some of the population pressures on our big capital cities, whilst supporting the growth of some of the smaller cities in some of the regional areas which are desperate for more people. question: are they the ones you announced during the election campaign? alan tudge: yeah, that\u2019s right. question: so fairfax and the abc pointed out that most of those are in lnp-held seats. how do you broaden that out so it becomes more across the city? alan tudge: well, i mean, when you look right across the country, so much of our dollars is actually going towards city-shaping projects. i mean, even one of the biggest projects here which we\u2019re announcing today out of the 12 \u2013 the coopers plains \u2013 is in a labor seat and we\u2019re putting $73 million towards that, and the lord mayor is contributing a further $40 million. the one that we\u2019re waiting for, actually, is for the state government to contribute to that project and then we\u2019ll be able to get on with it and get it done. question: have you been briefed on the delays to the metro project? alan tudge: we had a discussion in relation to that, and obviously we want to see the brisbane metro underway as quickly as possible. we\u2019ve had a discussion today in relation to that project, and i\u2019ll also be raising this with minister bailey this afternoon. question: the city deal would seem to cover a lot of this with getting everybody on board over a long period of time. what\u2019s the latest on that and how critical is it for it to get ticked off soon? alan tudge: yeah, that\u2019s right. so, we made a commitment to undertaking a south east queensland city deal between myself and the previous lord mayor actually, and the state governments, and the three leaders will be getting together again next week to discuss our progress there. this will probably take 12 months or so to work through, to do the proper consultation and to map out what will be a ten to 20-year plan for south east queensland; but which of course transport infrastructure will be a key component of it. but we\u2019ll also be talking about liveability; we\u2019ll be talking about employment hubs; we\u2019ll be talking about property planning and the like. so, we\u2019re taking our time in relation to doing this because we want to get it right. but ultimately it will be a great, long term plan for south east queensland where the three levels of government will be joined together and committing to it. question: and would that be one of the key ways to sort of get on top of the infrastructure problems raised in this audit? alan tudge: yeah, a little bit of both. i mean, we\u2019re constantly looking at funding good infrastructure here in brisbane, whether or not that be city-shaping infrastructure such as the m1 or the bruce highway or whether it be some of the smaller scale projects that we\u2019ve been talking about today with the lord mayor. but the city deal, no doubt, we\u2019ll also talk about some of the long term infrastructure projects which are needed for southeast queensland. question: can i ask about- in regards to the report for victoria, does this report confirm the victorian government needs to build the east west link? alan tudge: well, this report again emphasises the desperate need for the east west link in melbourne. now, this is on top of previous infrastructure australia reports, the victorian infrastructure report, it\u2019s on top of the labor party who used to believe in the east west link. and i certainly know that the tens of thousands of residents in the eastern suburbs of melbourne are desperately wanting this road to be completed. because at the moment it is the only major freeway in melbourne which comes to a full stop, when the east west link will take it from one side of the city across to the other. now, we understand and we respect that daniel andrews doesn\u2019t want to contribute financially to this project. therefore, we have said to him: we will fund the entire government contribution of this project. all we need from daniel andrews is for him to give us the greenlight in order to get this job done. question: and how much will it cost victorians to build? alan tudge: so, we estimate the project will be about $7 billion, of which we\u2019ve got $4 billion on the table ready to go towards it and we believe that we\u2019ll be able to secure $3 billion worth of private contributions. that is, the victorian government won\u2019t need to put in a cent in order to get the job done, but they do need to give the green light, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re simply seeking from them. i would point out though, that yes, we have a dispute with the victorian government in relation to the east west link project, and we\u2019ll constantly be prosecuting the case until this project is built. but by and large, we\u2019re actually working very cooperatively together and we have much more in common than we do have differences. and we\u2019ve got a lot of projects which we\u2019ve jointly agreed to undertake, and this of course includes the melbourne airport rail link, the geelong fast rail, the monash upgrades, the m80 upgrades, and so many more other projects across melbourne and indeed across victoria. we want to work cooperatively with the state government and all state governments; just as we work so well together with the brisbane city council. question: what do you say to commuters in sydney that that city is now- it will be the most congested, probably, for always? alan tudge: the good thing for sydney residents is so many of the larger-scale projects are coming to a conclusion now or in the next 12 or 24 months. you think of the m4 as part of westconnex, which has just opened a few weeks ago, and that will make a massive difference for those people who are coming in from the western suburbs into the cbd. obviously, the new part of the metro has been opened. northconnex is going to be opened next year as well, which would make a huge difference for those people in the northern parts- the northern suburbs of sydney coming into the city as well. there is so much construction work going on in sydney at the moment. in some respects, i think they\u2019re five or ten years ahead of melbourne now in terms of their construction works and melbourne\u2019s playing catch up, when it used to be the reverse. and i think we\u2019ll start to see the traffic and the trains work- i think we\u2019ll start to see the traffic flow so much more smoothly in the months and years ahead because of all these large scale projects coming to a conclusion soon. question: there\u2019s all this talk about record spending, but infrastructure australia says it might not be enough. alan tudge: well, infrastructure australia is saying that we probably need to maintain these record levels of expenditure into the years ahead. i mean, their modelling was in essence quite pessimistic modelling because it assumed that no more money would ever be going to any more projects in the decade ahead. now- and it also didn\u2019t take into account the fact that we added a further $25 billion worth of funding at last year\u2019s budget. so, we lifted our pipeline of work from $75 billion to $100 billion at last year\u2019s budget, and no doubt in the budgets in the years ahead we\u2019ll continue to invest money, just as the brisbane city council will and just as other state governments will. question: yeah, can i just ask value or net worth of the project - local, state, federal project - has there been any analysis of whether they? alan tudge: yeah. we took the city deal concept actually from the united kingdom, so they've been using that methodology for some time. the single biggest city deal that we've got, which is perhaps the best analogy for south east queensland, is the western sydney city deal. and that it\u2019s universally recognised as a terrific model combining eight local councils, state government, and the federal government towards a 20 year plan which will cater for 500,000 more people in western sydney, 200,000 houses to be built, 200,000 jobs to be created, and with road and rail infrastructure across western sydney as well. all of that, of course, is being stimulated by the huge investment which we have in the western sydney airport, $5.3 billion. so that's perhaps the best model which we have which shows- which i think is universally recognised as working and i think it's probably the model which we\u2019ll look towards as we\u2019re developing the south east queensland city deal to show what is actually possible. we're ambitious with this city deal. i think the lord mayor is ambitious for the three levels of government to outline this long term plan so then that we can be- have something that all levels of government can work towards over the long term which goes beyond the electoral cycles. question: we're talking a lot about roads, cars on our roads. should we not be trying to do something to get people out of cars and perhaps onto public transport? i mean, when are we getting a fast rail to connect sunshine coast to brisbane? alan tudge: as you probably know, before the election we announced our fast rail plan. and that outlined our ambition for many of the satellite cities or satellite regions of the big capital cities to be connected to fast rail in the next decade or two. we've put together a fast rail agency to help navigate this and we're also funding the business cases for the sunshine coast, for the gold coast, and also out to toowoomba as well. now, the first one, the first cab off the rank is the geelong fast rail in melbourne, and then we'll be considering the other business cases as they come through to us in the months and years ahead. but i think it can be a very powerful mechanism to not only connect some of the regional cities with the major capitals, but can also be a powerful mechanism to decentralise some of your population as well, because if people can live in a geelong or in a bendigo or a ballarat or up on the sunshine coast and have some of the more affordable housing there, be able to commute within, say, 30 minutes into the cbd, that way they can enjoy the lifestyle and more affordable housing while still being able to access the major jobs markets of the cbds. question: do you foresee any money for the cross river rail from the federal government? alan tudge: well, the state government has said that that's fully funded, so we're not going to be putting money towards something which the state government has said is fully funded. we're putting our money towards other projects which are our priorities.

alan tudge: well you've raised a couple of issues there. firstly, in relation to the reserve bank governor's points about needing more infrastructure - we are absolutely doing that in spades. in fact, we've doubled the infrastructure expenditure since we first came to government, and as we speak we've got 160 major projects being funded right around the country and melburnians know this because they see the construction going on all the time. often it's done in partnership with the andrews government, we have a good partnership there. and more needs to be done and we're continuing to work on that. paul kennedy: alan tudge, you won't get any opposition from me this morning on the spending, it's been acknowledged that there is record spending going along. but it's also pointing out that this is not exceptional and it should be the new normal. and in fact, we need to maintain this level of infrastructure and spend more and more in the next 15 years, otherwise the situation is dire with our population booming. alan tudge: yeah. so a couple of things on that - i mean firstly, we are doing that. i mean if anything, we're accelerating our expenditure rather than dropping it. and we\u2019ve outlined $100 billion pipeline of expenditure to the extent that we're now actually getting some pushback from some commentators saying that we're reaching construction capacity constrains. paul kennedy: who\u2019s saying that? alan tudge:\ni mean there\u2019s many economists who are saying that. i've had some discussions with the construction companies myself, and you can sort of see it in the price increase. paul kennedy: yeah infrastructure australia in this report is saying that there needs to be more and more. alan tudge: yeah i know. all i'm saying is that we've increased expenditure, we're accelerating that and we\u2019ll continue to maintain this level of expenditure, certainly from the federal level, and i would expect the state governments to also be doing that. but the flipside of that as well which is important, is on the population side. and what we did and this is since this report was written, we've dropped the migration rate to ease the population pressure, particularly on melbourne and sydney which have just been growing like gangbusters. we've also put in place new settings to encourage new people into the country to go to some of the regional areas and the smaller cities which actually need people. paul kennedy: infrastructure\u2019s not set up in regional areas either. in fact, even in the urban fringe, some 34 per cent of people are able to walk to public transport. the infrastructure is not there, that's been a failure on different tiers of government, isn't it? that you're encouraging people to move into those regional areas but it's not set up for good and productive and healthy living for those extra people. alan tudge: well it depends on where you are. so i mean there's places like warrnambool today, down the coastline here in victoria, who are just absolutely crying out for more people and we had the mayor of warrnambool just recently saying exactly that. they need an extra thousand workers today to fill the job vacancies which are there. we've got other regional areas across victoria and australia who are equally in the same position. and so that's why some of them are settings are geared towards encouraging more people, including new migrants to settle into some of those areas where the jobs are and just ease that pressure off melbourne. now, you\u2019ve got to understand that melbourne is growing at 2.7 per cent per annum, which is a phenomenally fast rate from a large city perspective. most cities are growing at about 1 per cent per annum in wealthy cities. paul kennedy: so what is the federal government going to do to increase infrastructure, for instance, i'll start with the inner urban communities? alan tudge: so i mean we've got the $100 billion pipeline of projects, much of which goes into our large cities. paul kennedy: let\u2019s talk about melbourne. you're a minister and you're based in victoria. alan tudge: yeah. i\u2019m a melburnian as well and i live in\u2026 paul kennedy: yeah. so let\u2019s talk about our place, let\u2019s start in melbourne. alan tudge: so if you talk about our place, i mean we've got very large scale projects which we are funding, working cooperatively with the andrews government. that\u2019s $5 billion for example to get the melbourne airport rail link, getting fast rail to geelong, which not only helps geelong commuters but can ease some of the population pressure off melbourne [indistinct] satellite city. the monash is - paul kennedy: what about the rail loop? you\u2019re not interested in putting money into the rail loop? the state government wants to- wants it finalised. alan tudge: we had- yeah, we had offered money in the past to the state government. in fact, we offered almost a billion dollars and the state government said no, they didn't need it and so they\u2019re getting on with the job. paul kennedy: i think they want it for that rail loop. alan tudge: are you talking about the suburban rail loop or the metro loop? paul kennedy: yes. alan tudge: for the suburban rail loop, the business case is underway at the moment. they've got $300 million, which is investigating that. they haven't come to us in terms of requesting funding because it\u2019s too early in the stage i think for that. in relation to the metro- paul kennedy: do you like it? alan tudge: i think conceptually it's not a bad idea. but- paul kennedy: what's good about it? alan tudge: this a very, very- it's a very long term project, this\u2019ll probably take three or more decades to build, it will probably end up costing a hundred billion dollars when it's completed. given the population growth- paul kennedy: minister tudge, sorry to jump in. that's what we're talking about, isn't it? long term planning, that\u2019s what we need. alan tudge: and that's what i said, conceptually i don\u2019t have difficulty with this. it's like us putting the melbourne airport rail link on the agenda, which frankly should have been built 20 or 30 years ago. we also want to connect monash university to the rail network and get that rail network all the way up to rowville. again, australia's largest university campus should have been connected to the rail link decades ago, rather than waiting until now. we've been leading with that agenda as well. so we're up for it and in fact, more of our money i think in victoria is going towards rail than it is to road because there's real capacity constraints there as well. paul kennedy: yeah. can i ask you about your comments in the herald sun this morning, talking about the east west link? that's not helpful is it, to continue banging on about the money for the east west link? the state government's not going ahead with it. alan tudge: well, you know, we've got a good relationship with the state government and we're working cooperatively on so many projects, some of which i've outlined. paul kennedy: that's going to more- annoy them, talking about that. alan tudge: well they know our position on the east west link. at the election campaign, we made this a very important feature, in the election campaign where we said to the state government - we understand that you don't want to put any money into this, fine.\nwe'll therefore increase our contribution to enable you to be able to build it without having to put in a cent. and so now that we're in that position, we're still arguing the case. we went to the election, we won the election. and so therefore have a mandate to prosecute at case and we'll continue to do that. paul kennedy: the victorian government won its election. the liberal leadership at the time said it was a referendum on the east west link. labor won that election. alan tudge: and in some respects, we respect the fact that they don't want to put a cent of state government money into it. we respect that. we're not asking them to put in a cent. we- all we are asking them to do is give the green light for it to go ahead because paul kennedy: they don\u2019t want it. alan tudge: the problems on the eastern freeway aren\u2019t going away and this infrastructure australia report again emphasises that this is one of the major bottlenecks in melbourne and will continue to get worse. paul kennedy: the infrastructure - just to be clear - the infrastructure australia report does not list projects. you can you can see that; it talks about overall planning. alan tudge: and let me quote from this report: the citylink eastern freeway connection across melbourne's inner north is predicted to remain one of the city's worst performers. paul kennedy: yeah. but it states current position. it doesn\u2019t list projects on- alan tudge: that\u2019s stated in this report now. okay you can call it whatever you like, but the connection from the eastern freeway to the citylink, most melburnians would know as the east west link. \u00a0 paul kennedy: i hear what you\u2019re- alan tudge: let\u2019s call it whatever you like. paul kennedy: no, i hear what you're saying but the victorian government would argue, i would suggest, that that they have decided to go another way to try and ease that. but our time is short, i know you have to jump on a plane. alan tudge: they\u2019re doing western distributor side which is almost the second half of the east west link. the remaining piece though is from the eastern freeway to connect up to the other side. and so, that's as i said, that's where we'll push, acknowledging that by and large, we\u2019re actually working very well with the state government, getting on with the job and so many other projects. paul kennedy: that is good. i know you have to jump on a plane, i know your time is short. can i just ask you again, about this - the comment about the urban sprawl across australia's east coast, that it's now over after decades of creeping out and out, into those green paddocks and taking over with housing estates. do you agree with that? is it finished? is enough, enough? alan tudge: ultimately it's up to state governments to determine what the footprint is in terms of urban sprawl. our populations are growing. there's still plenty of land but most of the growth, as identified in this report, has actually been in infill areas making the cities more dense. now that can have its issues as well of course, because sometimes people move into an area to get a bit more open space and then all of a sudden they find a big apartment block right next door to them and that rightly upsets them. paul kennedy: and do you feel a weight of responsibility with this report landing right on your desk. dare i say it, landing right on your shoulders. alan tudge: it's- listen it's a sobering report, but it's also, i would have to say a bit of a pessimistic report because the modelling which is done doesn't take into account the $23 billion worth of projects which we've announced over the last six months or so.\nand it assumes that no new projects will be announced over the next decade. now both of those assumptions i don't think are right. it also doesn't take account of the fact we have dropped the migration rate and got these new incentives for people to go to some of the smaller cities and regional area. but it is sobering. we will be looking at it very, very closely; they're a good outfit infrastructure australia, and they constantly inform our decision making. paul kennedy: it's good to hear from you this morning, we appreciate your time and i hope that you're right about the relationship between the feds and the state\u2019s ministers and all of those people trying to work for, well, not so much congestion for one thing, and all the long list of things that they're after. alan tudge, thank you very much. alan tudge: thanks very much. paul kennedy: minister for cities urban infrastructure and population, alan tudge there. "], "final-stage-northern-road-upgrade-ramps": ["12 August 2019", "shovels are in the ground for the sixth and final stage of the northern road upgrade at luddenham, eaton road and littlefields road. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the new and improved road would support integrated transport in the region and improve access, safety and travel times for road freight in sydney\u2019s west and southwest. \u201cthe australian government has committed $1.2 billion towards the northern road upgrade and we are getting on with the job of delivering new and improved transport for the residents and motorists of western sydney,\u201d mr tudge said. new south wales minister for transport and roads andrew constance said the works at luddenham were stage 6 of the broader upgrade of the northern road. \u201conce complete, the entire 35-kilometre upgrade of the northern road between narellan and south penrith will provide a high-quality connection with the m7 and m12 motorways and support western sydney\u2019s growing population,\u201d mr constance said. federal member for hume angus taylor said all the upgrades were part of the australian and nsw governments\u2019 $3.6 billion western sydney infrastructure plan to improve safety, reduce travel times and bust congestion. \u201cthis important road upgrade is all about making it easier and safer for motorists to get where they need to go. everything we are doing is about easing congestion so people spend less time in their car and more time with their family and friends doing the things they love,\u201d mr taylor said. federal member for lindsay melissa mcintosh said once stage 6 was complete, motorists would be able to travel on a four-lane divided road, improving their journeys to and from the new western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport at badgerys creek. \u201cmore than 15,000 vehicles use these sections of the northern road each day and this number is expected to significantly increase once the new airport opens in 2026, so it is important to get on with the job now,\u201d mrs mcintosh said. work will also be carried out to install new traffic lights and build a shared path for pedestrians and cyclists. the 35-kilometre upgrade of the northern road between the old northern road and jamison road is expected to be completed in 2022, weather permitting. the australian government has committed $1.2 billion towards the $1.6 billion the northern road upgrade project, with the nsw government committing the remainder. "], "master-builders-australia-perth-wa": ["09 August 2019", "thank you for the opportunity to speak today at the master builders australia conference here in perth. it has been a tough time for many in the construction industry in western australia, particularly in residential property construction, and this has had a broader impact on the economy.\u00a0 i want to discuss today how we are going about maintaining strong economic growth in australia, including boosting the growth in housing and infrastructure investment. i also want to touch on how these three things - the economy, the housing market and infrastructure - can come together through city deals, including one for perth. this year australia is on track to mark 28 years of uninterrupted economic growth.\u00a0 this remarkable record demonstrates the resilience of the australian economy and the strength of the economic fundamentals. in the march quarter of 2019, australia\u2019s real gdp grew by 1.8 per cent through the year, which while slower than the estimated potential growth rate, is comparable to other oecd countries. we maintain a triple a credit rating, the unemployment rate is close to what has typically been considered the \u201cfull employment\u201d rate of 5 per cent, and the federal budget is coming back to surplus for the first time in more than a decade. while it has been more challenging in western australia in recent times, there are also promising signs here also.\u00a0 your population growth has picked up a little recently, although it is still below the national average, and the unemployment rate has broadly remained steady. we went to the last election promising a strong economy and we are implementing our agenda to support this goal.\u00a0 during our first week back at parliament after the election we delivered massive tax relief for hard-working australians. these tax cuts are now law and will deliver an estimated $158 billion in tax relief over 12 years. over ten million australians, including over 1 million western australians, are now eligible for immediate tax relief of up to $1080. this immediate relief is the equivalent of a 50 basis point drop in interest rates. we continue to work on industrial relations reform, including providing greater powers to deal with registered organisations and officials who regularly break the law. we make no apology for requiring organisations to follow the rule-of-law \u2013 and giving courts the power to penalise them when they don\u2019t. our free trade agreements are also critical parts of the agenda to support growth by opening markets that were previously restricted. our education and training agenda is aimed at providing the skills for the future, and you may have seen comments from the government in recent days of our plans to make the training sector more responsive. however, there are two other parts to our economic plan that i want to focus on here given the audience: (a) the housing industry and (b) our $100 billion, 10 year infrastructure pipeline.\u00a0 both are key economic contributors in their own rights, employing thousands of people, but both also have broader impact on the economy. the construction industry (which comprises housing construction, in addition to other non-residential construction) employs almost 1.2 million people nationally and accounts for 9.1 per cent of total employment. the construction industry also constituted 7.5 per cent of gdp in 2017-18.\u00a0 however, as you would be aware, the housing market is also one of the critical factors underpinning consumer confidence and spending.\u00a0 when property prices are rising, homeowners feel wealthier and are more able to spend in other parts of the economy. this could include by using their property as collateral to purchase a motor vehicle or by using their increased asset income to buy more retail goods and so on. the rba estimates that a 10 per cent increase in net housing wealth may raise the level of consumption by around \u00be of a per cent in the short run and by around 1\u00bd per cent in the longer run. however, the reverse is the case also, and we have experienced some of that. across australia there have been declines in the housing market over the last few years, with combined capital city housing prices down by around 10 per cent from their peak in late 2017, although there are signs that this is starting to stabilise on the east coast, with prices lifting in recent months. here in wa, you have perhaps felt the housing price slump and the slowdown in the industry more than anyone.\u00a0 the number of dwelling approvals in wa over the december 2018 quarter was the lowest since 2001. residential commencements in wa have also fallen by almost 60 percent over the last four years. i hope we will soon see the green shoots here that are being experienced in the east coast markets. we are certainly on your side in supporting the growth of the industry. the morrison government has a range of initiatives to support the housing industry, particularly first home buyers who are trying to buy their first home. the first home super saver scheme is assisting first home buyers to build a deposit inside their superannuation to save for their first home. as of 31 may 2019, the australian tax office has released first home super saver amounts for more than 3,100 individuals, to the value of $37 million \u2013 which equates to an average release of around $11,800 per person. and, as of 14 june 2019, more than 4,300 people have used the downsizer measure \u2014 freeing up housing for younger families, and allowing older australians to contribute a combined $1 billion to their superannuation funds. the morrison government will also support up to 10,000 first home buyers each year through the first home loan deposit scheme, commencing on 1 january 2020. under the scheme, eligible first home buyers will be able to purchase a home with a deposit of as little as 5 per cent, without incurring the additional cost of lenders mortgage insurance.\u00a0 these will all make a difference.\u00a0 [\u2026] like with housing, infrastructure construction has both a direct and indirect impact on the economy and, as such, is also a critical part of our economic plan. infrastructure supports the economy in three ways: it supports immediate economic activity; it builds economic capacity for the future; and it helps people live better lives by minimising transport costs. since 2013, the coalition government has announced around 900 major infrastructure projects, with some 160 under construction right now. we have also announced more than 25,000 smaller projects, with around 24,000 of these projects already completed. five years ago that the coalition\u2019s $50 billion infrastructure package was lauded by then-ceo of infrastructure partnerships australia brendan lyon as \u201crepresenting the largest-ever national infrastructure investment program.\u201d since then, the coalition\u2019s commitment to productive infrastructure investment has only intensified.\u00a0 in the april budget this year, we lifted transport infrastructure expenditure from $75 billion to a record $100 billion over ten years. about $43 billion of this will be delivered over the next four years. this is the most comprehensive infrastructure investment agenda the commonwealth has ever embarked on. this infrastructure pipeline is beginning to have a huge impact on the construction sector. in february this year the respected macromonitor reported that australia is in the \u201cmiddle stages of our biggest ever transport infrastructure boom\u201d. over the 12 months to march 2019, over $29 billion worth of transport construction has been done. compare this to the $23 billion worth of construction done in 2016. and this is only the beginning. macromonitor forecasts that we will reach close to $45 billion worth of transport construction in 2022. this is an all-time high, larger than the amount of transport construction we saw in any single year during the mining boom. this means billions of dollars in new projects here in wa, including $5.7 billion over the next four years, towards critical projects such as the next stages of metronet, upgrades to the tonkin highway as well as projects in our regions such as the albany ring road and bunbury outer ring road. this unprecedented level of investment builds on our existing commitments to projects that are underway or nearing completion, such as the $1 billion northlink wa project, which will be fully completed by the end of the year. of course, we want to see roe 8 and 9 built. we have $1.2 billion ready to be deployed as soon as a state government is willing to get on with the job.\u00a0 also at the 2019-20 budget, we announced a string of congestion-busting projects under the national urban congestion fund. we recognise that while our larger, city-shaping projects such as metronet will deliver huge benefits to commuters, these projects have long lead times and work is needed in the interim to bust congestion on our local and arterial roads. the urban congestion fund is delivering smaller, targeted works such as intersection upgrades, widening works and level crossing removals, and in wa, we have already announced $200 million out of the fund towards these projects. we want to get these under construction as soon as possible. i want to finish my remarks today by discussing the potential of our city deals and to reinvigorate the perth city deal. city deals were initiated by our government three years ago and are a mechanism for the three levels of government to agree on a 10 to 20 year plan for a geographical region, typically focused on the very things i have been discussing so far today: housing, infrastructure, and jobs. the most comprehensive of the city deals that we have struck and are implementing is the western sydney city deal. this 20 year agreement between the federal and state governments and 8 local councils, outlines an agenda for over 180,000 houses to be built, 200,000 jobs to be created, and rail and road infrastructure across western sydney. it complements our $5.3 billion new western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport and is universally recognised as a great way of planning a better future for western sydney\u2019s growth. in april 2018, the australian and western australian governments committed to negotiating a city deal for perth, but it is probably fair to say that we haven\u2019t given it sufficient attention to date. today i want to inject new energy into a reimagined perth city deal. i know from my conversations with rita saffioti, the state minister for transport and planning, have confirmedthat the western australian government shares this commitment. the potential of perth is enormous.\u00a0 it is already a vibrant, wealthy and increasingly multicultural city.\u00a0 over the next thirty years, however, according to the latest abs projections, perth\u2019s population is expected to grow from 2.1 million to around 3.2 million, requiring thousands of houses, townhouses and apartments to be built, as well as the foundations for new jobs, services and recreation across the city. how this is managed will determine the city\u2019s economic success and livability in the future.\u00a0 in developing these plans, perth has the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of melbourne and sydney.\u00a0 in both cities, insufficient infrastructure was built in advance of the population growth.\u00a0 sydney is just catching up now with its huge investments in the last five to 10 years, while my home city of melbourne is still a decade behind in my opinion. perth is in a stronger position with good city-wide infrastructure already in place.\u00a0 the yanchep rail line extension, for example, is a good example of planning the right infrastructure for the future.\u00a0 the huge investment in metronet, of which the federal government is contributing $2.5 billion will provide the rail backbone for the whole city for decades to come. the challenge is to leverage these investments and do the population and employment planning now for the future.\u00a0 perth cannot continue to sprawl north and south indefinitely over the decades ahead.\u00a0 as we invest billions in metronet, we should be considering how to ensure greater density of housing around the future train stations.\u00a0 we should also be thinking about how to have greater density generally in the central business district so that it is more vibrant, inclusive and safe at night. melbourne provides a good example of how to do greater cbd densification. relocating university campuses into the cbd can also help bring vibrancy and enhance the night-time economy and this was a key part of the darwin and launceston city deals. these are the types of things that can be outlined in a perth city deal.\u00a0 it cannot be put together overnight and needs community input including from key organisations such as the mba and property council. but if we get it right, it can really set perth up well for the future. let me finish by again thanking you for the opportunity to address your conference, and thanking you for the contribution that you are your member organisations make to our society - in building homes and workplaces and providing job for hundreds of thousands of people. we have the best country on the planet, with some of the most liveable cities.\u00a0 together, we can continue to keep our economy strong, our communities safe and our cities the envy of the world.

through some of the details of it, of which we've put in $19 million at the federal level and the state and the local councils have each putting five million dollars. this project is important for both direct reasons and indirect reasons. directly, it creates 200 jobs and it will save local residents 70 per cent of their time in the morning and in the peak traffic. so a real direct congestion busting project that this project is going to deliver. but it also has indirect benefits in terms of it becomes a really important route down to the jandakot industrial estate, which in the future there will be 8000 jobs there and 300 businesses. so that's a great industrial estate that\u2019s going to be growing into the future and this road is of course going to be important for that. it's also important for the future development of the metronet, which is a huge project which the state and federal governments are jointly funding and really will create a backbone for this city over the next 30, 40, 50 years so this is a critical project for that development as well. i\u2019ll probably also- i mean, it would be remiss of me not to also point out that initially of course, this particular project, the karel avenue upgrade was on the original designs for roe 8 and while the state government unfortunately didn't want to proceed with that, we at the federal level of course, would still like to see that underway. we've got $1.2 billion remaining on the table. we want to see the job done. i know that the residents locally want to see the job done because it would take 7000 trucks off the south perth roads, even the unions want to see it done. so we'll be continuing to prosecute the case in relation to roe 8 and 9 being built. but overall, this project is a terrific project. it's good for jobs, it's good for local businesses, it's good for residents and it is another great project where state, federal and local governments are working together to bust congestion and make perth an even better place to live. rita saffioti: thank you, it's a great pleasure to be here on yet another road project commencing across wa. this was an election commitment we took to the last election and we knew that this was a bottleneck, that it was getting worse and the congestion was ever increasing. so with yaz, we made an election commitment to fix this project. since the election of course, working with the federal government, together with the city of coburn and also with jandakot airports, we are now able to deliver a significant project $29 million. that will see the duplication of karel avenue it will be a new bridge over roe. it will be the widening and lengthening of this bridge over the rail line. importantly, it started with the thornlie-cockburn link, in the sense that the bridge will be widened to facilitate the extra train line of the metronet program. this will create jobs and it also facilitate, as the federal minister said, the continued expansion of the jandakot airport district. so a really important project. a project that helps local communities and really if anyone drove it this morning, they know the serious congestion on that area. it's a 70 per cent time saving once the project\u2019s completed. this project together with other projects in the area, including the armadale road duplication. the new armadale road, north lake bridge the widening of the freeway, the smart freeways is a significant investment in reducing congestion and improving safety in the southern suburbs and we are very keen to continue to work on projects that deliver real benefits. thank you very much. question: minister any comments and reaction to the comments reaction that? alan tudge: we will just let the federal member and maybe the state member say a couple of words as well and also of course the ceo of the council. ben morton: thank you ministers, in politics, it isn't always about disagreement. and here we are on a project that we agree because it's very important to both yaz\u2019 community and to my community. it's great to see the federal minister and the state minister here for the sod turning today on this project which is very, very important to our local community. for me personally, as the federal minister made very clear, this is the most eastern part of the roe 8 extension. this was a project that was part of the roe 8, roe 9 extension and will serve for a future extension, when a future government accesses the $1.2 billion that's available to build roe 8 and roe 9. roe 8 and roe 9 is very supported in the local community here south of the river. it will take significant cars and trucks off local roads. when there is $1.2 billion available to the state government to build roe 8 and roe 9, i think western australians expect the state government to look at ways in which that funding can be accessed. now let me just point out a few other projects that are currently underway that would have formed part of the roe 8, roe 9 project. this project would have been part of roe 8 and roe 9. the murdoch connect project obviously is occurring on land where the roe 8 project would have gone across and there is funding and partnership working with the state government on stirling highway, south street interchange as well. one point too, despite the federal government agreeing to the funding for these three projects - part of roe 8 and roe 9 - the full $1.2 billion remains available to the state government to make our local community safer here in the southern perth area, to also create much needed jobs that\u2019s there now. the treasurer josh frydenberg and the prime minister have made it very clear that that $1.2 billion is available and i would encourage the state government to access it. i've made it very clear that the objectives of that funding is to get cars and trucks from the roe kwinana interchange through to the commencement of the existing four lane stirling highway at fremantle golf course, without passing through a single set of traffic lights. i encourage the state government, if they don't like the design that was proposed by the barnett government, they should at least look at design changes, small changes to the design that achieves the exact same objective, because this is a project that's much needed in the southern suburbs. rita saffioti: any questions? question: yeah, more aboriginal names, please. [laughter] question: any reaction to what they just said about roe 8? rita saffioti: i think it's unfortunate that what is meant to be a celebration of a new project where there's commonwealth and state agreement, that it becomes hijacked into a political stunt. so, i'm here wanting to build roads and get on with it, reduce congestion. this is a key election commitment. that's what i'm focused on. i'll let these guys do the political stance and i'm here wanting to get on with work. question: is it the case that when the [indistinct] of roe 8? rita saffioti: on roe 8? question: yeah, no where the one of the maps of roe 8 and 9 i think, oh wait sorry roe 9? rita saffioti: well look, i don\u2019t want to go into the detail of it. i mean i'll go through and i can go through all the reasons why we're not doing it. in particular, that was a major election commitment. in particular, that was putting freight on rail and all those other aspects. but i'm here wanting to talk about karel avenue. like i said i don't think these sort of project announcements should be hijacked for political stunts. any other questions of the day? question: yeah, can you tell us about the radical greens group that has threatened to take over the streets of perth? is that a worry? rita saffioti: well look, we support peaceful protests, but i sometimes believe that when people go too far they actually hinder the cause. so i would always say peaceful protests. put your views across but we don't want any interruptions in relation to how people go about their daily lives. as i said, i really believe that sometimes people hinder their cause. make your point of view, put the case forward. and of course we know that climate change is a serious issue. but make sure that it's done in a respectful way. question: should commuters\u2026 alan tudge: can i say something about this too? that some of these feral groups have been disrupting cities across the world and in my view, if they're disrupting cities and they're breaking the law, then i hope the police are there to charge them. and we respect people who can protest peacefully, but they shouldn't be disrupting people who are getting on with their ordinary lives, they shouldn't be breaking the law, and they should be held to account if they are doing so. i mean we've got a very strong policy in relation to climate change. we've got a 50 per cent per capita reduction by 2026. we will meet that target. we've got more renewables per capita coming into this country than any other country in the world over the decade ahead. s o our record is there, the delivery will be there and we want to get on with the job. and i think everyday people across perth or any other city in this great country want to get about their business without some of these feral\u2019 interrupting them. question: alan, can you commit to that there won\u2019t be a toll on roe 8? alan tudge: well, this will be up to the state government in terms of what they choose to do. i mean in relation to that project- and we are talking about karel avenue as great project which we're jointly doing together, $29 million which we're putting in 19 and the state and councils each putting in five. but on roe 8 and 9, we do want to see this road built and we will continue to prosecute the case for it. in relation to tolls that's ultimately up to the state government in terms of what they decide to do on that. question: did you discuss with the state opposition on this matter? alan tudge: i'll be meeting up with the state opposition leader later today and we'll be discussing a full range of things. but inevitably this will come up as well. question: mr tudge, can i ask you about something andrew hastie has said in relation to china? he said that australia is facing an unprecedented economic and security test and he's likened the approach to china to the failure to prevent the rise of nazi germany. alan tudge: yeah, i'll leave commentary in relation to that to the prime minister today. i believe he's doing some media or the foreign affairs minister. question: i\u2019ve got a question to the transport minister. should perth commuters be concerned about these protestors? rita saffioti: well i\u2019ll get an update from my transport agencies in relation to this, but like i said hopefully it's done respectfully and there's not a lot of interruption. but i'll get further advice from my transport agencies. question: do you know whether the premier will be responding directly to their demands? rita saffioti: the premier\u2019s on his way to coag, so he is out of range at the moment but i will find that out later today. but as i said, he's on his way to coag and it's a long trip up to cairns. question: minister, do you have any comments in relation to andrew hastie\u2019s comments on china? he\u2019s referring to what he sees as a delicate diplomatic balancing act. is wa in a difficult position, given its strategic value of its trading relationship with china? rita saffioti: all i say is that wa's economy is or that china plays a big role in the wa economy. and a lot of jobs in western australia rely on a productive relationship with china. so, we've always been very keen to make sure that we have good relations with our export partners like china, like japan, growing in india. so we're really keen to continue to have strong relations because wa\u2019s economy, wa jobs and wa families rely on that relationship. question: with the boat fire yesterday. do you have any update on the state of that investigation what caused it or anything like that? rita saffioti: no sorry i don't have that update but we'll try and get some information for you today.

in south australia include: "], "adelaide-doorstop": ["07 August 2019", "stephn knoll: it\u2019s great to be here this morning with minister tudge. we\u2019ve just come out of a long and very fruitful discussion about the joint commitment that the morrison and marshall governments have to improving infrastructure and improving congestion here in adelaide. we have utilised this relationship to its utmost extreme and been able to deliver benefits for south australians and we saw that in the first \u2013 well the first federal budget last year post our election to government where there was significant new projects put on the table. and in the federal budget that was handed down in february, there was some 11.5 per cent of the national share of funding coming here to south australia. we confirmed our proportion of that money in the state budget and now we're getting on with the next stage of delivering these projects. this is what happens when two mature governments work together, they get on and they deliver for their people. and this relationship is bearing fruit for the people of adelaide and especially those people who live in those congested areas where we've got projects, [indistinct] separations, intersection upgrades, that are going to help them to get home that much more quickly. so it's fantastic being here and to have minister tudge here. it's essentially - well i'll hand over to minister tudge, great news that we're getting on with these projects as soon as possible. alan tudge: well thanks so much stephan. it's great to be here, back in adelaide again and catching up with minister knoll. today, we've really been focused on two things. we've just had a long two-hour meeting and we were focused on firstly, the ten urban congestion fund projects which comprise of $700 million worth of projects in 10 project- in 10 locations around adelaide. now, these are just those real local congestion hotspots in adelaide that we want to fix as quickly as possible. so we've each put in $350 million plus, into these projects and we've agreed today that all of them will be under construction within 12 to 24 months with some beginning at the end of this year. so that's a good development because i know that residents want to see these projects done quickly and certainly it's great for the economy because it employs people, gets the economy active and going as well. the second project that we've discussed is obviously the very big one into the north-south road and again, we've just been discussing what is going to occur for the final stage of that. and we've just had some briefings from officials in relation to the latest update on that, and we continue to work through that project. the business case is still underway. we're going to be receiving that soon and obviously, we each have very considerable sums of money, $2.7 billion each on the table to see that final stage done. we've got a great relationship with the south australian government. we're working very cooperatively together on these city shaping projects but equally, we're working cooperatively together on these smaller urban congestion busting projects because we want to make life easier for residents of adelaide so that they can get home sooner and safer. can i just also just make one comment about the regional institute of australia's report today which has been widely reported across australia. now, their report is a very good one and in essence arguing that we need to have a broader distribution of population growth across the country. and this is certainly the morrison government's ambition and this is what we've articulated in our population plan which we outlined just two or three months ago. we want to see places like adelaide grow more quickly, we want to see parts of regional australia grow more quickly where they can and we've got plans to support that. we've got infrastructure plans, we've got migration plans and we've got fast rail plans to support that broader distribution of that growth. so we welcomed the regional institute of australia's report today and we will be continuing to work on plans to take that bit of pressure off the big capital cities and support the growth of the smaller cities like adelaide and the regional areas of australia that do want to grow more quickly. question: so having the funding and then the starting dates sort of been discussed this morning, are any of these projects new? alan tudge: well, all of these projects were announced over the last three to six months. those 10 projects, which add up to over $700 million worth of investment, here into adelaide. what is new today is our agreement - and this is the first in the country, that we've got the two levels of government having an agreement that we'll be getting cracking on every single one of them within 12 to 24 months, with the first one beginning within six months. every single one of them is under- is being planned as we speak and we made commitments collectively that we will get these projects done because they're absolute bugbears for residents here in adelaide. and today, we've gone through the schedules, we\u2019ve mapped it out and we're going to get on with it, so it's good for residents and it's good to local economies. question: how can we be assured that you're not rushing into this in saying that it's all going to be done over the next 24 months? and you know, there might be some complications along the way or things done not properly or you know? stephn knoll: sure. so we've been working furiously since the federal budget was handed down. the federal government has given a massive gift to south australia in providing funding for these projects. it's now our job to get on and deliver them and the good news is that for the notorious goodwood road, springbank, daws road intersection will be first cab off the rank. there's been a lot of planning and design work that\u2019s being done and we're really into the land acquisition process and by the end of the year, early next year, we will see solid construction start on that project. that's great news for the people of the southern residents, some who've been waiting for up to four decades for this thing to be fixed. but also can i point out that there's a lot of planning design work that's gone on underneath but it needs to be supported by money, it needs to be supported by commitment from the federal government that's going to provide us with the cash flow to get on with these projects as soon as they're ready and able to happen. and that's what we got and that's the outcomes of the discussion today, that we've got two levels of government - grown up mature governments, willing to sit down and work together to get on and deliver for people. instead of playing games or having fake fights with canberra, we've got again, two governments working together and that delivers outcomes for residents and for the people that live around the goodie, springbank, daws road intersection and all of those people coming in from the south who use goodwood road, they're going to be the first beneficiaries of this relationship. question: can i ask the federal minister how have you found getting around adelaide and negotiating all the road works? alan tudge: so i mean adelaide, like many of the other cities of australia, is also facing some serious congestion and i see that myself when i'm here in adelaide and you particularly see this in the morning peak hours and in the afternoon shift when people are going home. and we're collectively, between the two levels of government, doing massive city shaping projects such as, obviously, the north-south corridor, but those ones take years. in the meantime, we want to address these really localised congestion pinch points which cause people so much grief and that's what we've been discussing today and that's what we've got the commitment now to get on with it, get these projects done so that people can get home sooner and safer rather than being stuck at those intersections. question: minister knoll, can i just ask you on public transport? the tourism transport forum released a survey today that shows there\u2019s no evidence that privatising public transport is a good thing. what do you make of that survey\u2019s results? stephn knoll: well i haven't seen that survey. but i reject the fact that we\u2019re privatising public transport here in south australia. we will continue to own all of the assets and continue to own the stations, the tracks, the rolling stock but outsourcing is a tried and proven model and there's strong evidence to support that and whether that be infrastructure australia's 2017 report that showed that there are strong benefits from outsourcing, that can be reinvested into better services. and we know that this works and it drives patronage growth because it's precisely what's happened around the country, it's precisely what's happened here in adelaide and whether it's perth, whether it's adelaide's buses, whether it's the melbourne network, whether it's parts of the sydney network, whether it's new zealand or europe, we know that this outsourcing model works. and the proof will be when we start to see increased services as a result of this change, people will know that it's a good thing. we've already given the guarantee that we will maintain at least the existing level of services; we've already given the guarantee that we will continue to own the fare box. we've also given the guarantee that we're going to hold onto the assets because they are public assets and need to be in the hands of south australians. but what we also need to do is drive competition in this sector and the best way for us to do that is to provide a competitive tender model that drives the cost down of providing these services, takes those savings, and reinvests them in better services. question: and what do you make of australian energy regulator taking legal action over wind farms that are involved in the state-wide blackout? stephn knoll: well the matter is now before the courts and so that restricts us on what we're able to say, but we have lived energy policy failure in this state like nowhere else. the most expensive electricity in the country, if not in the world, a state-wide blackout that made us the laughing stock of the nation. we took to the election a strong policy of how we fix these issues and we are stepping those out piece by piece to help reduce power prices. we certainly welcome the regulator doing what they're supposed to do and that is enforcing the energy rules. we obviously can't make comment about the specific issue because it is before the courts. but i think that this is endemic of the fact that there is a problem in south australia. we're getting on and fixing it and we need to make sure that every power player in the energy space plays their part to help improve reliability and bring down prices for locals. question: you spoke about the final stage of the torrens to darlington is there- you said you were still in the business stage or the planning stage of it. is there a preferred way to go with that? underpass, overpass, what are you think at the moment about that? stephn knoll: so this is precisely what we were asking the business case to do. do we continue to do overpasses and underpasses like we see on the torrens project or do we bite the bullet and look at a tunnelling solution that's going to deliver longer term benefits? we're in the final stages of business case on that. as you can see, we're working constructively with the federal government. we need both tiers of government to be comfortable with the solution, we are talking about the largest infrastructure project in this state's history. we have to get it right, we are spending the money and getting the expert advice to give us the best answers and we're

alan tudge:  what do you mean by that? kieran gilbert:  i guess they\u2019re focusing on this issue and your agenda. what\u2019s your response? alan tudge:  i\u2019m happy about to talk about infrastructure every single day of the year because we\u2019ve got a massive agenda, kieran, as you know. a $100 billion program which only five years ago was a $50 billion program, now it's a $100 billion program rolled out over a 10-year period. and that means we've got major projects going on right now in every capital city. and this is not only just good for busting congestion and helping commuters, but of course it helps the economy as well, both immediately with jobs and also improves the productive capacity of the economy overall. annelise nielsen:  it was an interesting strategy by labor in question time yesterday. they were being very specific about smaller projects. they wanted to know why the bridgewater bridge upgrade in hobart didn't have a timeline to it yet. alan tudge:  yeah. annelise nielsen:  what do you make of that strategy? alan tudge:  well that's not a small project, that's in fact a massive project for tasmania. it\u2019s $461 million of funding from us. and it's like all these very big projects, they need to be worked through. you do a business case. in that case the business case has been done. but there were some technicalities which came out of it, some more work is being required, some geotechnical work. once we know that, then the state government gives us the construction schedule and then we re-profile our money basically according to that schedule. now, that occurs with every major project and the labor party knows this and yesterday they were just playing politics with these big projects. they did it exactly the same when they were in government and we're doing the same here. we take it steadily, assuredly, but we get the job done. kieran gilbert:  do you think it's an interesting \u2013 as annelise said there \u2013 a number of backbenchers asking the questions yesterday and keeping it tight. they want specific answers. this is probably a refreshing approach, isn't it, to question time? alan tudge:  well as i said, as i said, they can ask questions about infrastructure every single question time and i would welcome it because we've got such a good agenda here. kieran gilbert:  one of the elements of the agenda that i guess remains unanswered is the east west link. you're pushing so hard on that, you're a member in the eastern suburbs of melbourne as well, but the state government is not going to relent on this. so this is again a stalemate over one of the biggest spending initiatives you made in terms of infrastructure. alan tudge:  at the moment we've got more in common with the state government than we disagree on, but that's the big one that we disagree on. and we still want to see this road completed. and as you probably know, at the last election we put $4 billion on the table which would enable the road to be built without the state government having to spend a cent. of course, they're the only ones though that can actually do the construction. and so we rely upon them to do it, but they don\u2019t have to spend a cent, and that's why we're pressing them to say let's just get on with it, because it's the only major freeway in melbourne which comes to a full stop at the city rather than connecting up across the city to other freeways. annelise nielsen:  you can't say victoria hasn't been putting a lot of money and emphasis on infrastructure. they've had their huge level crossing removal program rollout, and it was an election winner for them. why not just give them the money for a project they actually want? alan tudge:  well, in some respects we have. so this money is in what's called our contingency reserve. so it's not cash outlay as such. i mean, we massively increase the expenditure to victoria over the last six to 12 months. an enormous number of urban congestion fund projects, as well as some of the major projects, such as for the monash, we've got the m80, we've obviously got fast rail to geelong, a $2 billon commitment that we want to get underway, as well as all sorts of other projects. kieran gilbert:  have you learnt from the andrews approach in terms of, as annelise referred to there, the rail crossings? he admitted to getting rid of 20 in his first term, he got rid of 29, continuing now in the second term. it's been a big winner for him, both in an amenity sense, i guess, for people getting through and from work and so on, but also in a political sense because it breeds a sense of competence in the government that they're getting things done. i guess your congestion busting fund could be seen in a similar light? alan tudge:  i mean, i give daniel andrews credit for the level crossing removal program. he's done a good job there and does make a substantial a difference to people's lives, and increases the capacity of the rail network because you can get more trains through and not worry about level crossings. in relation to us, i mean, we're just targeting, we're acknowledging with this that a lot of the difficulty for commuters is not necessarily being held up on the freeway, but it's actually at a local intersection which needs to be improved. and that will cause them a 15-minute headache every single morning. and if we can fix that, that will make a big difference to their daily lives as well as support the economy because tradies will be able to get through more quickly, businesses will be able to distribute their goods more quickly. annelise nielsen:  just on the flipside of what kieran was saying, it was a huge vote winner for the state government, but is this the federal government getting bogged down on what should be state issues when you should be looking towards bigger goals? alan tudge: annelise at the end of the day, residents don't care who does the job. they just want the job done. so we've listened to them, they've said very loudly and clearly that they want their roads fixed, they want more money in public transport and that's what we're doing. kieran gilbert: the prime minister earlier in the week said that he wants some discipline from the coalition party room particularly in the context of things that you did take to the election, and in that context referring to superannuation and newstart and people making their push on those particular issues. yesterday senator bragg in his first speech made his argument about superannuation, that the government shouldn't be pushing through to 12 per cent compulsory super. should he be cut a bit of slack because it's his maiden speech? alan tudge: i think with your maiden speech people deem to get cut a bit of slack and superannuation has been one of the things that andrew bragg has a lot of expertise in, having worked in that industry. and he put that idea out, it's not on our agenda of course. our agenda is very clear in relation to superannuation. but i think what it showed that andrew bragg is just another very, very capable individual that's come in for the liberal party and we\u2019ve got a number of them. kieran gilbert: but it's not sort of snubbing the prime minister's edict on having more discipline? alan tudge: as i said, for the maiden speeches often people will float some policy ideas out there. annelise nielsen: did you put any policy ideas in your maiden speech? alan tudge: i did, i did. annelise nielsen: what were they? alan tudge: i mean i talked a lot about education improvements, small business improvements, welfare reform, indigenous recognition, infrastructure. kieran gilbert: the point is it doesn't have to be a government policy or an official liberal party policy for someone to articulate that in their maiden speech, that's the bottom line? alan tudge: we've had a number of maiden speeches and they have been brilliant, many of the maiden speeches. we've got such a good cadre of people coming into the liberal party and national party and even last night we had david sharma who is just a stellar candidate, i think he topped the year in his hsc in new south wales. he was the youngest ambassador to jerusalem, he's now a member of parliament and gave a beautiful maiden speech. he articulated some policy there as well, as have many of the others. and that's often the case. kieran gilbert: but on superannuation, the government's firm and will be sticking to the gradual increase of the superannuation guarantee? alan tudge: our position is incredibly clear on that. we took it to the election and that's what we're doing. annelise nielsen: and i guess from the liberal perspective what we've heard is that they just want to be having these conversation in the party room. but what is the concern about just having the conversation with the public and brining them along with you? alan tudge: i know you always prefer it, annelise. annelise nielsen: so does the public, our viewers. alan tudge: our focus from the government's perspective is obviously implementing the agenda which we took to the election and it was a big agenda. so that's what we're getting on with. kieran gilbert: but isn\u2019t the beauty of the liberal party, as we've been reminded many times by you and others, is that you're a broad church. you're allowed to have opinions. alan tudge: and we\u2019ll always have very robust discussions and people will differ from time to time in their views but our firm focus, led by the prime minister, is implementing our agenda. my firm focus is obviously alongside the deputy prime minister is the infrastructure agenda, the cities agenda, implementing our population policies as well. kieran gilbert: so should the pm just, you know, relax a bit? alan tudge: i\u2019m not giving the prime minister any advice. kieran gilbert: should he relax a bit about the backbench advice? alan tudge: kieran, i\u2019m not giving the prime minister any advice here on your program and we\u2019re focused on the agenda. i\u2019m here to talk about infrastructure. i will talk about it day in day out. i'll talk about cities policy and population policy day in day out. and we've got a very big agenda and we're getting on with it. kieran gilbert: thanks so much. we\u2019ll see you soon alan tudge, appreciate it. alan tudge: thank you.

alan tudge: not at all. in fact, we've got a record amount of expenditure this financial year on infrastructure, almost double the amount that what we had before we came to government. and that means there's major projects going on, fran, right across the country, particularly in our big capital cities. i mean, projects like a western sydney airport in sydney, or the m80 here in melbourne, or north-south road in adelaide. it's underway right now, but if we want to do more, of course we are ready to do more, but it's ultimately up to the states to bring forward their schedule. fran kelly: okay, just in terms of record commonwealth spending, correct me if i'm wrong, but i think there's around $30\u00a0billion of $100\u00a0billion over the forward estimates over the next three years. that's 0.37 per cent of gdp, that's comparable to previous years, isn't it?

isn't he talking about large infrastructure structure programs by and large? alan tudge: they're the other opportunities as well, and that's what i was signalling yesterday, that we do have a pipeline of other projects as well, fran. and they're in the planning, and you do need to go through a rigorous planning exercise with the very big projects. you can't switch them on overnight. but if the states are able to bring forward and accelerate that planning, then we're willing to negotiate with them to bring forward our funding. fran kelly: because it sounded like in the comments yesterday, it sounded like you were basically criticising the states for not doing enough. i mean, and there is evidence, as i said before and given some examples, the states are doing a lot of the heavy lifting. $56\u00a0billion on roads and rail in new south wales over the next four years. if the commonwealth is so concerned that these projects need a kick along, why does the commonwealth help from the metro west link, which needs commonwealth funding to proceed, for instance? alan tudge: well we've got our priorities, we've outlined our priorities in each state and territory. and some of those state governments haven't picked up on yet either, including for example the east west link here in melbourne. that is a project which the states wouldn't have to pay a cent in order to actually get built because we've committed the entire government share of it. fran kelly: just on that one, because i think i've asked you this before, the state government of daniel andrews has rejected that. it's been re-elected overwhelmingly, it rejected it again. it doesn't think that's a priority. why doesn't the commonwealth, if you're so keen to get the state spending money on large infrastructure, just swap those funds to something that victoria does want to build? alan tudge: well we've already got $27\u00a0billion worth of funding going into victoria with massive projects going on. but on top of that we did say leading up to the last election, and one of our big commitments in the last week of the election, let us fund the entire amount and get on with the job because it is one of the only major freeways in the country which comes to full a stop in the city rather than connecting through the city onto another one. it has to be done, fran. infrastructure australia says it has to be done. infrastructure victoria says it has to be done and we're willing to pay the entire government share to get the job done. so, i'm still hopeful that we can negotiate something with the andrews government in victoria to get the job done because there's 50,000 motorists every single day that rely upon that work being completed. fran kelly: you're listening to rn breakfast. its 17 minutes to eight. our guest is alan tudge. he's the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure. philip lowe, the reserve bank governor, wants infrastructure projects run more like monetary policy, at arm's length from the government. he said, and i'm quoting here, some more independence with project selection would be a good idea. why should the public trust the government to get it right when it's clear that, not just your government, but governments use infrastructure budgets to favour marginal seats. i mean we saw that in the last federal election, corangamite in victoria, a very marginal seat that the morrison government was desperate to hang on to, in the end you weren't successful, given more than $26,000 per person in commitments at the last election. alan tudge: well i don't accept that figure but we do have infrastructure australia who provides advice to us on every single major project. fran kelly: but you don't take its advice on every, i mean there are many projects funded by the commonwealth that aren't signed off on infrastructure australia. alan tudge: so every single major project has to have a detailed business case done and it has to go to infrastructure australia for their assessment. but at the end of the day, come each budget period, the government of the day has to make the determination as to which piece of infrastructure goes next. fran kelly: so in other words it is not this arm's length, independent project selection the reserve bank governor is talking about. alan tudge: that takes into account what infrastructure australia says, that obviously takes into account what the state governments want to do as well and frequently they'll have their own pipeline of work which they come to the federal government to help fund as well. so that's generally how the process works. increasingly the federal government is taking the lead and putting projects on the table and encouraging the states to join up with us and the melbourne airport rail link is a classic example of that, where we put money on the table and then a year later on the andrews government also came to the table and said let's get on with it. fran kelly: sure. but what about this notion of more independence in project selection. that's what the reserve bank governor suggested. why isn't that a better idea? alan tudge: well, because at the end of the day the government of the day is accountable for the big financial decisions which have to be made and we have to submit ourselves to elections and to the accountability through that process. and they're big decisions, they're taking taxes from people to pay for those, and at the end of the day we take the advice from the experts and then make the decisions though and accept responsibility for them. fran kelly: i know you're not the industry minister, but you are the urban infrastructure minister and we've got these problems with cladding, combustible cladding and other building defects, they're going to come to a head tomorrow at this meeting with commonwealth and state ministers. victoria has taken the lead, it's announced a $600\u00a0million remediation program to rid buildings of flammable cladding but it wants the federal government to kick in half of that. you've said no, and yet isn't nation-wide cladding removal exactly the sort of job creation project that you're spruiking here. it needs to be done. it will create jobs immediately in local communities. doesn't it exactly fit the description of what you said earlier? alan tudge: well, fran, i mean there's all sorts of projects which could be done. fran kelly: this needs to be done though. alan tudge: this absolutely needs to be done but at the end of the day these are state responsibilities. the federal government has nothing to do with building regulation, it's entirely constitutionally the responsibility of the state governments. and frankly, it's been their compliance failures over the last years which has caused these problems. so we're saying to the states it's terrific that you're taking responsibility for it. get on with it. we would like to support you in terms of providing some national consistency in terms of the regulation, that's what minister andrews is doing. but in terms of fixing up the cladding problem, that's ultimately the states' responsibility. fran kelly: so there'll not be a dollar coming from the federal government? alan tudge: well it's the state's responsibility. fran kelly: so, no? alan tudge: at the end of the day we have our responsibilities, the states have their responsibilities and sometimes there's some shared responsibilities. in relation to building regulations, we have nothing to do with that. it's entirely the domain of the states. this was a failure of compliance, and, ultimately therefore the states have to take responsibility and fix it. that's what daniel andrews is doing and we're encouraging other states to likewise. fran kelly: minister, thank you very much for joining us. alan tudge: thanks very much fran. fran kelly: alan tudge is the minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure.

"], "transcript-abc-news-jane-norman": ["16 July 2019", "jane norman: alan tudge, welcome to the program. alan tudge: g'day jane. jane norman: well, the victorian state government today has announced a $600 million package to fix hundreds of buildings with high-risk cladding and it\u2019s asking for some commonwealth assistance. is this a request that you'd consider? alan tudge: this is a good announcement from the state government that they\u2019re getting on with the job of trying to fix some of those really serious issues which people are facing in relation to cladding. in relation to what the federal government's role is, this will be no doubt brought up at the ministerial meeting on thursday which karen andrews is leading. most importantly, i think that karen andrews is trying to establish some national consistency across regulations state by state. in terms of the particular funding proposal, that will no doubt be considered by minister andrews and the prime minister in due course. jane norman: that meeting is looking at, as you say, national regulations. the minister wants to put together a taskforce to work with the states and territories to come up with some sort of nationally consistent building code, if you want to call it that. it\u2019s about time the states and territories signed on to that, isn't it? alan tudge: at the end of the day, these things are governed by the states and territories but minister andrews has showed some leadership in trying to bring people together and have some, i think, greater national consistency across the country. so let's hope that there\u2019s a constructive meeting on thursday when all the building ministers get together to discuss this. jane norman: several building groups or industry groups have written to the minister asking her to act on this issue, saying that the federal government needs to restore confidence in the building sector. we understand it's going through a real crisis of confidence at the moment. but given the apartment block disasters we've seen in sydney, melbourne, given the cladding issues, they haven't exactly covered themselves in glory, have they, this industry? alan tudge: as i said, they\u2019re largely governed by the states and territories, these matters. but karen andrews is trying to take some national role here and provide some national leadership. i\u2019ll leave the rest of the commentary to her in relation to it. but obviously, it's not great for individual residents if you have bought a house or an apartment and thinking that it\u2019s going to be a safe apartment and then you only discover down the track that it's actually not a safe place to live and there's costs associated with that. so, that\u2019s the issue at hand. i think daniel andrews made a good announcement today, and let's see what evolves from the meeting on thursday. jane norman: do you think other states and territories should take daniel andrews' lead in terms of actually putting to some state government money to fix cladding issues in other states and territories? alan tudge: well, they\u2019ll each have to consider that and i think they\u2019ll be looking very closely at what daniel andrews did today. but i\u2019ll leave the rest of the commentary, jane, on that to minister andrews, and she\u2019ll have more to say on this today, no doubt, as well as on thursday after the meeting. jane norman: all right, under your portfolio, infrastructure, you are today urging the states and territories to bring forward some projects they\u2019ve got in the pipeline to help boost economic activity. so where are these projects and are any of them, as they say, shovel ready? alan tudge: yeah jane there\u2019s a couple of issues here. my most important point that i\u2019ve been saying today is that we\u2019ve actually got a massive infrastructure pipeline underway right now. in fact, only five years ago, the federal expenditure was $50 billion. now, it's $100 billion of investment and this, in some respects, deals with some of the reserve bank governor's comments in relation to needing to put infrastructure into place in order to support the economy. we are doing that. but there are also opportunities to fast-track some other projects, and there\u2019s three areas which i think that we can do that in. firstly, in some of the projects which we have planned underway at the moment, if they\u2019re able to be brought forward, then we're willing to negotiate the funding there. second, there\u2019s some projects which we\u2019ve put money on the table where the state governments haven't yet committed to, and the biggest one there is the east west link here in melbourne. but thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, is that we've announced 160 smaller urban congestion projects, suburb by suburb, and we really want to get those going as quickly as possible, because it means that you fix up those urban congestion hotspots. but it also means you\u2019re putting in $5 million, $10 million, $20 million into a local community, and that means jobs and that means economic growth in those particular suburbs as well. jane norman: you mention east west link there but the victorian daniel andrews government doesn't want that project, so aren't you kind of flogging your dead horse here? alan tudge: we\u2019ll be continuing to push this project until it is complete. jane norman: but is that the role of a commonwealth government? isn't it up to the states to decide where urban infrastructure should go? alan tudge: well, increasingly, the federal government does have a role in setting priorities as well. now, another big project here in victoria where we put it on the agenda and did convince the state government to come on board is with the airport rail link. now, we put $5 billion on the table just a little over 12 months ago now. it took a while for the state government to agree to it but now they have and we\u2019ll finally get that rail link built, and everybody agrees that that needs to be constructed. there\u2019s also almost a strong view that the east west link does need to be constructed as well. certainly, infrastructure victoria has said that. infrastructure australia has said that. the 50,000 people who take the eastern freeway every single day know it has to be completed. and we\u2019ve said to the state government that we\u2019re willing to pay for the entire government share of that road for it to be built, and so we\u2019ll still be putting pressure on the state government to take up that offer and get that road completed. jane norman: okay. so in your negotiations with the states and territories over the possibility of bringing forward some sort of state-based infrastructure projects, would you at the same time commit to expediting commonwealth approvals? because, as i understand it, there are some state projects waiting but they\u2019re still waiting for their federal funding to be approved. alan tudge: what typically happens is that we'll profile our federal contributions to a road according to what the construction time frame is that the state governments have set. now, if the state governments want to fast-track those construction time frames, then we're open to looking at whether or not we can re-profile our funding to match that and that's what we\u2019ve said today. on top of that, if there are other projects which we have got federal money associated with, and i mentioned the east west link but there\u2019s others as well, that the state government wants to get going on, we\u2019ll be able to bring forward that money as well to get on with those projects. east west link being one of them, the rowville rail. obviously, over in western australia, there is the roe 8 and 9 project as well. jane norman: during the election campaign, labor promised that it would restore infrastructure australia to what it once was, give it back its independence and make it the pre-eminent advisory body on infrastructure. now, the argument was this would address issues with pork barrelling by both parties and would also address what they described as the short-termism of thinking when it comes to these big infrastructure projects. is this something that you should consider? would it actually help you get more bipartisan support with the states for big projects? alan tudge: well, infrastructure australia still is an independent body, operates at arm's length from the federal government, and every single major project that we fund will go to infrastructure australia first. it will be assessed by infrastructure australia to determine the cost benefit analysis before any funding is determined and provided for that particular project. they do some great work in terms of working out where you do get the highest bang for your buck in terms of their priority list, which they put out regularly, and we do pay close attention to that priority list. and so we\u2019ll continue to work with infrastructure australia, we\u2019ll continue to listen to them and we\u2019ll continue to invest in record amounts into infrastructure overall. jane norman: you may listen to them, but it's not always the case that you actually take their advice. isn't that correct? alan tudge: well, at the end of the day these big, often billion dollar decisions, are decisions of government so we will listen to the advice of infrastructure australia. it\u2019s always considered and we take heed of that. but at the end of the day, governments will make decisions, particularly when they are, as i said, billion dollar decisions or hundreds of millions of dollars. they\u2019re big decisions for governments and we\u2019ll take those appropriately. jane norman: okay alan tudge, i want to ask you about constitutional recognition for indigenous australians. the minister for indigenous australians ken wyatt put forward his ambition last week for a referendum in this term of parliament. how realistic do you think that is? alan tudge: well, i do think it is realistic. and ken wyatt is the person that would be able to do it. it's going to be tough though and we need to work steadily and we need to bring everybody along the journey. and that's what ken wyatt has articulated. because unless you actually get a very broad consensus across the community, you won't be successful in getting a referendum question up. that's been the experience across time. as you probably know, only eight referendum questions out of 44 have been successful and the last really substantial one that passed was the 1967 referendum. so, we have got to be cautious here, we\u2019ve got to be steady, we\u2019ve got to bring people along the journey, and that's what ken wyatt has committed to doing and working very closely with linda burney, who's his shadow from the labor party, as well as other members of the parliament. jane norman: there\u2019s long been a divide in this debate between those advocating symbolic recognition and those wanting something more substantial; certainly indigenous communities made it pretty clear through the uluru statementthat they want substantial change. what are your thoughts? which side of this debate do you fall on? alan tudge: we've said, and the prime minister\u2019s indicated this, that we\u2019ve got some reservations in relation to this voice concept, which came out of the uluru statement, but we are committed to having indigenous recognition in the constitution. i guess at the end of the day, we do have to get a broad consensus across, at the very least both parties, but also across indigenous australia as well. and that\u2019s the real challenge here. and different people have got different views on this, but unless we do come together and reach a broad consensus across indigenous australia, across the two major parties and, indeed, bringing the rest of the australian public on board, then we won't be successful and we won't get a good outcome. i have always thought, to be honest, jane, that the process itself is as important as the outcome. because the process is making us think very deeply about what is unique about indigenous australians to this country, and how we properly do recognise them as a people and the fact that they\u2019ve been here for 40,000 or 50,000 years, and we have to go through that discussion still before we get to the final outcome. jane norman: so, the voice appears to be one of the more contentious issues. whether or not it gets into the constitution is one question. do you think there could be a compromise, whereby the voice to parliament, as some sort of advisory body, becomes a legislated body, something that the parliament determines? alan tudge: yeah this will be something which ken wyatt will have to consider in the discussions. at the moment, obviously we have committed to go through this process and to see how far we can get through this process, which ken is leading. we have for some time have had a prime minister's indigenous advisory council, which has provided advice to government and there's been some very good people on those indigenous advisory councils, which has provided that advice. whether or not we get to what you're discussing there, i don't know. that will be, time will tell going through the current process, as to how far we get. jane norman: okay and just finally, from one very complex and divisive issue to another, and that is religious freedoms. your colleague, the attorney-general christian porter, is drafting a religious discrimination bill. there are calls in the party to go a bit further, though, and actually enshrine religious freedoms in legislation. what are your thoughts on that? would that be going too far? alan tudge: again jane, as you pointed out, this is a really sensitive matter, which we do have to carefully work through. we are 100 per cent committed, though, to introducing a religious discrimination bill. we do want to ensure that people can practise their faith freely in this country as one of the fundamental rights which people should have. but there's some really tricky issues which need to be worked through very calmly and very sensitively. we don't want to make this a divisive issue, but we do want do introduce this bill and make sure there are proper protections for people to exercise their own faith. jane norman: so you seem to be falling on the side of the religious discrimination bill, as opposed to going further and enshrining rights in legislation? alan tudge: well, that's been the commitment which we have made, is to introduce that religious discrimination bill. but again, we're taking this very calmly and methodically and we do want to bring the australian people with us so it doesn't become a divisive issue. it's important for a great many australians and we recognise that. we recognise that religious freedoms are fundamental to people's identity and who they are as a person. but we have just got to get this right and therefore the attorney-general's just calmly going about this, consulting broadly, until we get the right answer. jane norman: so you say that it's important to people of faith that you\u2019ve obviously been speaking to, but it's been difficult finding actual examples where people's freedoms have been eroded. philip ruddock's own review into the religious freedoms in australia found that it was a) hard to find examples of this in real life and b) that australians largely enjoy a very high level of religious freedom. so why is this an issue that the government needs to be legislating? alan tudge: at the same time, philip ruddock did outline 20 recommendations and we've adopted 15 of those recommendations and the other five more complex ones we have sent to the australian law reform commission to examine. he did identify a number of issues and consequently we are enacting those recommendations, or at least 15 initially, while the other five are getting further consideration. jane norman: all right alan tudge, we\u2019ll have to leave it there but thank you for your time. alan tudge: thanks very much jane.

alan tudge: well i don't think that's a fair characterisation of what i've said. i\u2019ve outlined in an article today in the australian financial review. and in essence, my main message there was that we have enormous amounts of infrastructure going on right now across the country, including in victoria, record amounts, by both the federal level and the state level. but if we want to do even more, there are a number of opportunities there, some of which of course involve the state governments, because ultimately they're the ones that actually do the physical building of the infrastructure, whereas we\u2019re the primary funder on many of them. jon faine: the victorian state government actually is spending more in the forward estimates on infrastructure than the federal government for the whole of australia. how can you say that, for instance, the victorian government's not doing enough? alan tudge: well again, that's not my characterisation. i'm merely saying that\u2026 jon faine: i\u2019m not asking if it\u2019s your characterisation, i'm asking you when the victorian government is spending more than the commonwealth, how can you say the states aren't doing their share? alan tudge: but jon, you\u2019re putting to me a false assertion there. so what i'm saying is that at the federal level, we're putting record funding into infrastructure across the country. $100 billion over the decade, and the amount of money which we're spending this year is double that of what we came into office. the state government is also investing record amounts in infrastructure here to victoria too, and on many of these projects we\u2019re partnering really well together. the biggest one of those is the airport rail link, $5 billion each. that's in the planning stage at the moment, construction will begin in 2022, and we want to get that built as quickly as possible. we've also got though, jon, and this is one of the things which i\u2019m in discussion, in good discussions with my state counterpart, as is the prime minister with the premier, over the smaller-scale suburban projects. now, if you fast-track those ones, you can get $5 million, $20 million into local suburban communities, and it makes a real difference to those communities in terms of the jobs which it creates. and of course, it fixes up those congestion pinch points at the same time. so they're the types of things we really want to get cracking on and we're having good discussions with the states at the moment in relation to those. jon faine: one of the problems that the unexpected win in the federal election has posed for scott morrison, and you as one of his senior ministers, is going to have to, you're going to have to solve some of these problems, is that you don't really, you didn't really come out of the election campaign with a blueprint, did you? you weren't expecting to be back on the government side of the parliament, so you got caught by surprise. alan tudge: well jon, again, i wouldn't agree with your characterisation there. i mean, we've got a massive blueprint in terms of our economic agenda. now that includes obviously the big tax plan which we've just passed the parliament, which delivers tax cuts to millions of australians. a thousand bucks into their pocket as soon as they get in their tax return this financial year. in addition, this $100 billion infrastructure program that's over a decade, that's a massive part of our agenda. we've got defence expenditure going on. we've got all sorts of other programs underway as we speak, jon. so i don't agree with that. and my message though is in relation to the infrastructure expenditure. we've got a massive program going on and people see this across melbourne. many of those projects are supported by federal money. jon faine: and finally, before we hear from your state counterpart, the humiliation of your colleague \u2013 the minister for indigenous affairs ken wyatt at the national press club \u2013 publicly committing the government to a process of constitutional recognition and then getting cut off at the knees the next day by the prime minister. alan tudge: well jon, again, i\u2019m not going to agree with your assertion there. he made he made a carefully calibrated speech there. you should read the speech. he's an exceptionally good minister and i think he'll do a great job in terms of navigating that\u2026 jon faine: but what do you tell us about the dysfunction behind the scenes when one of your senior ministers makes a public commitment one day, and then he's undermined by the prime minister's office the next? alan tudge: well again, i disagree with your assertion. i mean, we've got a commitment to working through a process towards constitutional recognition of aboriginal people, and minister wyatt, the first indigenous member of the cabinet, the first indigenous person who's an indigenous affairs minister, is carefully working through this. now, it\u2019s not a simple matter, constitutional recognition. we have to bring the community along, and we just have to take it steadily, consult broadly, and that's exactly what he's going to do. jon faine: thank you for your time. alan tudge, federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure. alan tudge: thank you.

alan tudge: g\u2019day kieran. this will obviously be considered in due course. i\u2019ve just heard that premier andrews is proposing to take this to coag to be discussed there and no doubt he\u2019ll be discussing this with the prime minister beforehand, and i\u2019ll leave that obviously to the prime minister to address. kieran gilbert: but given that this has been prompted obviously by events overseas, the grenfell tower tragedy and so on, this surely should be welcomed by the federal government that the victorian government is moving to act and make the highest risk building safe for residents. alan tudge: well, this is a really serious issue and it is good that daniel andrews is taking action here. i\u2019m not across the details, i\u2019m just literally hearing it for the first time as i\u2019ve been sitting here in the studio so in terms of any formal response from the federal government, i\u2019ll leave that to karen andrews or the prime minister to fully respond in due course. kieran gilbert: sure. okay. well on the infrastructure, no doubt, daniel andrews will be asked about your comments today in the afr very shortly. but up until this point, he\u2019s shown no inclination to back the major road project, the east west link that you want to fund in melbourne. why doesn\u2019t the federal government look elsewhere in terms of saying okay, we\u2019re not going to get a deal on that, let\u2019s put some infrastructure spending elsewhere in one of our biggest cities? alan tudge: well in essence, kieran, we are doing that and we\u2019ve got massive projects right across victoria which we\u2019re investing in, in partnership with the state government and actually we have a very good relationship with the state government in terms of getting infrastructure built, perhaps no bigger one than the airport rail link which is a $5 billion commitment each, to finally connect up australia\u2019s second biggest airport by rail. the east west link is obviously a project which we think is vitally important because it will finally connect up the eastern freeway to the other side of town and ease the traffic for 50,000 commuters every single day. now, our message to the state government is obviously that we\u2019re happy to pay for the entire federal contribution but putting that aside, we\u2019ve largely got good co-operation with the state government. we want to see other projects done quickly and i\u2019m in good discussions with the state minister in relation to those other projects, particularly some of the smaller urban congestion fund projects which are in the suburb by suburbs across the city. kieran gilbert: and on some of the larger projects as well though, you\u2019re talking about the need to expedite those, the federal government, i think the treasurer is going to making a similar point at lunch time today. what sort of things can you do to smooth out the planning and approval processes to expedite those? alan tudge: in some respects, as you\u2019d know, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion in relation to how you can accelerate the progress of our major infrastructure in australia. now, part of our response is to say well actually, we\u2019ve already been doing this. we\u2019ve already massively ramped up the expenditure on infrastructure from what was a $50 billion program five years ago, which was a record then, to now a $100 billion program today over the course of a decade. on top of that though, if we do want to do further work, then there\u2019s three areas which we think that we can accelerate even further but all three do require state cooperation. the first is to fast track some of the 120 large projects which we have in the planning phase. the second is actually to get on with some of those big projects which the state government hasn\u2019t yet committed to such as the east west link. and the third, and this is the most tangible one, is that we\u2019ve got well over 100 projects around the country which are small-scale suburb-by-suburb, $5 million here, $20 million there which we want to get happening as quickly as possible. i\u2019m in discussions with my state counterparts to see if we can get really cracking on those, not only to make a difference to local residents to fix up those congestion hotspots, but also to provide additional jobs in those local communities. kieran gilbert: let\u2019s just go back to where we were a bit earlier in terms of the east west link because it\u2019s relevant to something else you\u2019ve said there. in terms of the states and whether or not they\u2019re acting sufficiently, isn\u2019t it fair to say that victoria is almost at full tilt anyway right now? so the question is would they have the capacity to make way for that particular project or at least facilitate that project? alan tudge: that\u2019s some of the feedback which premier andrews has been saying, is they\u2019re getting close to capacity and in particular in relation to concrete capacity. i suppose my message there would be that if you\u2019ve got concrete shortages, let\u2019s then expedite the quarry approval process so that we don\u2019t have that in the future. should we even give the go ahead to east west link today? it would obviously still take a few years to do the detailed planning work et cetera, before you can really get the major construction underway. so in the meantime, let\u2019s get cracking in terms of approving quarries so we don\u2019t have those shortages. kieran gilbert: what about the other states, are they doing enough? i know you go to central brisbane, you see the cross river rail, sydney\u2019s got various road projects, they look like new south wales is moving quite sufficiently. are the various other states doing enough in your view? alan tudge: well most jurisdictions are also investing record amounts in infrastructure, just as the federal government is. new south wales is leading the way there and they\u2019ve had a massive program now for a number of years, largely supported by the coalition government federally. we\u2019ve obviously in new south wales got a huge project which we\u2019re funding entirely but the state government is also supporting us with road and rail connected to this and that is the $5.3 billion western sydney airport. that project, kieran, will transform western sydney and it is going to be the largest earth-moving exercise in australian history to flatten out that area around badgerys creek to create an enormous airport out there, which will be twice the size of sydney\u2019s airport is presently. but there\u2019s other projects going on in sydney as there are around the country. the overall message is that, supported by the federal government, there is record amounts of funding in road and rail projects going on around the country. we\u2019ve massively ramped that up and that\u2019s a really important support for the economy overall, both now during the construction phase, but of course it increases the capacity of the economy overall so it has long-term impacts as well. kieran gilbert: so given all of that activity, why then has the rba governor made more than a dozen requests in recent months for governments to do more on infrastructure? it sounds, according to what you\u2019re saying today, that you believe it\u2019s sufficient. alan tudge: well the governor also did point out that our infrastructure plan is supporting economic growth, so he\u2019s made that point. and you do need to read carefully what he is saying. and i suppose we\u2019re point out that almost in response to some of the governor\u2019s comments is that we have massively ramped up our infrastructure expenditure. at last year\u2019s budget it was $75 billion, in this year\u2019s budget we\u2019ve increased that to $100 billion. we\u2019ve announced 900 major projects since we\u2019ve been in government. fully a third of those have been in the last 12 months alone, so you can see the ramp up in infrastructure expenditure already and that will continue on. i\u2019m pointing out today in an important article in the australian financial review, that if we want to even accelerate further, well there are opportunities there and i\u2019m in discussions with the deputy prime minister is also, in discussions with our state counterparts, to see whether or not those opportunities can be fulfilled. kieran gilbert: quick one to wrap up minister, before i let you go, this analysis out of the treasury, the australian reports it today, that stubborn workers basically is how they\u2019re described, not moving to more productive companies is putting downward pressure basically on wages growth. should more onus though be put on companies given rising profits, that the onus be put on them to increase wages and provide that incentive to either move or to increase productivity. alan tudge: yeah kieran, the treasurer is giving a speech today and he\u2019ll no doubt address some of those comments and i\u2019ll just leave it to him to address those points today. kieran gilbert: okay. we\u2019re out of time. alan tudge, we\u2019ll talk to you soon. alan tudge: thanks very much kieran.

[indistinct] the economy in that way. patricia karvelas: okay. your infrastructure and population plan has been out there for months, but still philip lowe has said further infrastructure spending is needed, especially with interest rates at record low, the economy having spare capacity, and some of our existing infrastructure struggling to cope with ongoing population growth. will you do more or accelerate the spending? alan tudge: well, a couple of things. firstly, philip lowe has been saying some of these things for some time now; and the second point is we are massively increasing the expenditure around infrastructure. indeed, in the may budget of this year, we increased the expenditure from $75 billion to $100 billion over the decade, a huge increase. and that means in this year alone, we\u2019ll be spending $9.8 billion on transport infrastructure and there\u2019s more money spent on other forms of infrastructure as well, and that\u2019s more than double what is was just five or six years ago. so we\u2019ve massively increased it. and that means every major city, within country towns across australia, there are infrastructure projects going on right now, to the extent that some commentators are actually saying that we\u2019re almost hitting at capacity constraints from a construction perspective. patricia karvelas: but with interest rates so low, and obviously borrowing money has never been cheaper, is it worth or are you considering ordering a review of ready-to-go projects just in case you need to bring them forward? alan tudge: well, there\u2019s about 150 major projects already under way. we\u2019re talking typically $100 million or more and some in the billions of dollars. and we want those done as quickly as possible. and if that can be done more quickly than the current time frames then our profiling of money will typically follow that. where we do want to really get cracking on some more projects is with the congestion-busting projects, which we\u2019ve been announcing over the last six months. now we\u2019ve got 166 of those, $3 billion worth, and they\u2019re smaller projects in the suburbs across our big cities; $10 million projects, $20 million projects. and we want to see those really get cracking. and it\u2019s the smaller projects actually which are of course much easier to get going straight away than initiating the very large-scale projects which of course takes some time to do the planning and the consultation and the procurement et cetera. so i'm in discussions with my state and territory counterparts right now, to see if we can get those 166 smaller projects happening as quickly as possible. i want them to start tomorrow frankly but let\u2019s get them going as quickly as possible. patricia karvelas: okay so out of those 166, how many are shovel ready? how many are ready to go straight away? alan tudge: well i i'm having very constructive discussions with my state, ministerial counterparts as we speak. so, i've met up with all of them now and in some cases i've met them a couple of times. and in the weeks ahead i'll have the plan from each of them in terms of what can be done and when. but certainly we want to roll those out as quickly as possible. not just because it's going to impact tens of thousands of residents on a daily basis and make life easier for them, fixing up those local congestion hotspots, but also because it does of course provide further stimulus. patricia karvelas: so is that where the government will look if the economy does need further stimulus? because clearly this big tax package, 10 years\u2019 worth of a tax package, a pretty significant change to the tax scales has now passed. but to actually get cash into the economy and create jobs you need to do that in a different way and perhaps sooner. is infrastructure the vehicle for that? alan tudge: well i mean we are putting cash into the economy through these tax cuts in a very significant way. and i mentioned that at the outset 1,080 bucks for 10 million australians coming into their pocket. the infrastructure pipeline it's not only the 150 major projects happening right now, there\u2019s 1000 smaller projects going on. plus there\u2019s other major projects in the planning as we speak too. now they inevitably take some time to work through with the very large-scale projects; the billion dollar plus ones, they do take time. but obviously we would see those done as quickly as possible and in many cases we've got money there in the budget ready for those projects to be done. so the pipeline\u2019s there. we want them done as quickly as possible and we're working constructively with the states and territories to see that that's the case. patricia karvelas: just before i let you go i know that the attorney-general's begun the official consultation briefing process for the religious freedom or the religious discrimination act. what do you think its parameters should be? do you think it should have an impact on employment contract law for instance to cover cases like israel folau? alan tudge: these are these are really difficult issues and we're just going to work through them very cautiously and sensibly. we have made some commitments that we will have a religious discrimination act. [indistinct] some way, as some of the, you know, a sex discrimination act, so that people don't suffer discrimination because of their religious beliefs. but we've just got to work through it calmly and sensibly and the attorney-general is leading that work, consulting with people and there is a broad discussion in the community. but let's just take our time and address those sensibly and bring the australian people along with us as we do so. patricia karvelas: alan tudge, thanks for coming on. alan tudge: thanks very much pk. patricia karvelas: that's the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, alan tudge. "], "transcript-sky-news-live-interview-kieran-gilbert-and-annelise-nielsen": ["05 July 2019", "kieran gilbert: let\u2019s get more now on the debate around infrastructure. joining us is the infrastructure minister alan tudge. the finance minister this morning when we spoke to him, mr tudge, said that he thinks that the rba governor\u2019s comments have been over-interpreted. what\u2019s your vide? alan tudge: well what the rba governor was saying is that we need infrastructure investment as one tool to keep the economy strong, and it certainly is a very big component of our economic plan. and we\u2019ve massively increased our infrastructure investment from what was a $75 billion pipeline to now a $100 billion pipeline. so we\u2019ve increased that by $25 billion just in the may budget. so this is a record amount and it means we have massive projects going on right across the country as we speak. 150 major projects and about 1,000 small-scale projects going on as we speak. it\u2019s the bulldozers going, it\u2019s the bitumen being rolled out, it\u2019s the concrete being poured. this is what\u2019s occurring right now in our big cities and across the country. annelise nielsen: the rba governor did flag that there is benefit to be gained from investing in the regions in particular. does it seem like the regions would have a lot of confidence in the morrison government putting that infrastructure investment in when you\u2019re specifically being touted as the minister for congestion busting? that\u2019s more of a big city issue. alan tudge: well, in some respects we\u2019ve got two infrastructure ministers now. i mean, that\u2019s an indication of the importance of this to australians as well as to the economy. michael mccormack tends to look after the regional infrastructure while i look after the urban infrastructure. we\u2019ve got record money though flowing out into the regional areas. i will say in terms of though where we can get new projects up and running very quickly, and that is with the urban congestion fund money. now, as you probably know, we announced a lot of projects. in fact, 166 projects over the last six months which are typically in the 10 to 15 million or $20 million scale in suburb by suburb around the country. now, those smaller scale projects are easier to ramp up and get going quickly and we want to see them done asap. i want to see them started tomorrow if possible, and i\u2019m in discussions with my state counterparts to see how quickly we can roll out those medium-scale projects, $3 billion worth. let\u2019s get them cracking, both to help local residents as well as being further economic stimulus. kieran gilbert: you\u2019ve been talking about this overall envelope of infrastructure spending. but is there room to bolster that further? the finance minister this morning seemed to be suggesting a flexibility in the government, if the time\u2019s warranted, then you will deliver that. alan tudge: inevitably as budgets roll on, we re-examine what our expenditure outlook is. but i emphasise this point: that we are at record levels of infrastructure investment. i mean, this year just in transport infrastructure it\u2019s $9.8 billion which is more than double what it was when we came to office just six years ago. so it\u2019s a massive increase. state governments are also spending record money on infrastructure, to the extent that many commentators are now saying that we\u2019ve got some capacity constraints in the construction market, is what some people are saying. but what i\u2019m indicating is that how can we get more going quickly right now, and that\u2019s where the small and medium-scale projects is what we want to see happen immediately and that\u2019s what i\u2019m in discussions with my state counterparts about, to get those ones going asap. we\u2019ve got the money there, $3 billion worth. let\u2019s get cracking. annelise nielsen: when it comes to the rba governor\u2019s comments though, will more of that money be going to the regions? alan tudge: we do have record money going into the regions with what\u2019s called the rosi program and michael mccormack looks after that. and that\u2019s rolling out. we\u2019ve got thousands of projects going on across the country in terms of small-scale projects as well as massive-scale projects such as inland rail and the bruce highway. both of those are $10 billion projects. kieran gilbert: now in terms of the government\u2019s win this week on the tax cuts, it\u2019s the big policy platform. beyond the tax agenda, what else is the vision of the morrison government? alan tudge: well the tax agenda is a massive reform. it delivers obviously $1,080 to individuals who earn less than $126,000 and that\u2019s about 10 million people. they\u2019ll get that in the next few weeks when\nthey put in their tax return. so that\u2019s a massive bonus for those hardworking australians, but it\u2019s also important economic reform because it flattens out the tax rate and that creates better incentives for people to work harder. i mean, in addition we\u2019ve got a very large economic plan on top of that: the infrastructure plan which i\u2019ve talked about; the free trade agreements which we continue to negotiate; industrial relations reform; continued record investments in schools and in training which are obviously important in terms of providing skills and improving the productivity of the workforce over time. so, these are really important elements as well which bolster our overall economic plan. annelise nielsen: when it comes to the next few sitting weeks of parliament, we know they\u2019re a little bit ways away, but it does seem like a lot of power is vested with the crossbench. do you think that it\u2019s giving them a lot of power, the agreements that have been struck with the crossbench so far? is it going to be an ongoing challenge for the government? alan tudge: we have to work with the crossbench constructively, maturely, we\u2019ve been doing that very well for many, many months now and we\u2019ll continue to do that. and i think the fact that we could negotiate these significant tax cuts through the senate with the assistance of the crossbench shows that we can actually work well with them and deliver good reform for australians. kieran gilbert: alan tudge, we appreciate that. thanks so much. we\u2019ll talk to you soon. alan tudge: thank you.

the government is cutting the permanent migration program by a cumulative 120,000 places over four years. the new cap is 160,000 per annum, down from the cap of 190,000. the average intake over the last five years has been 183,000. within this 160,000 cap are 23,000 places for permanent residents who choose to reside outside the four big capitals. this comes into effect in 1 november 2019. second, the government is introducing strong incentives for new international students to choose locations outside of the big capital cities. international students are the largest component of the temporary migration program, with the 80 per cent studying in melbourne, sydney or brisbane. a new $94 million scholarship program to study in the regions also comes into effect. destination australia will provide 4,720 scholarships. changes to the working holiday maker program also come into effect, including increases to the number of countries involved and places available, and allowing people who work in the regions to stay an extra year. the plan will eventually allow students studying outside of the big capitals to receive an extra year of post-study work rights. this would provide the typical students studying in the regions or smaller city three years of post-study work rights. third, the national faster rail agency begins operating from today. the new agency will oversee the government\u2019s 20-year fast rail agenda, which will connect satellite regional cities to our big capitals. this will allow people to reside in regional centres with its cheaper housing and regional lifestyle but still access easily and daily the major employment centres. the first fast rail connection will be melbourne-geelong. finally, a new centre for population is also being established inside treasury from 1 july, providing detailed analysis and advice on population issues. $23.4 million has been provided to establish the centre. minister for population, cities and urban

gareth parker: yeah. alan tudge: yeah it was about 7 degrees when i was walking around this morning and i was feeling it, and i\u2019m still a bit frozen to be honest. gareth parker: well we\u2019ll blame someone. hey, so you\u2019re meeting with rita saffioti, the state transport minister. alan tudge: yes. gareth parker: there\u2019s a lot on the agenda and there\u2019s a lot on the agenda i think for every state at the moment there\u2019s a bit of an infrastructure boom that\u2019s in the pipeline. the question is can we kind of accelerate it, isn\u2019t it? because this economy and this state is still struggling. and i think the question that is on everyone\u2019s lips is can we prime this pump when it comes to big projects, get it moving sooner? alan tudge: yeah certainly infrastructure is one good way of generating jobs and being a stimulus for the economy and we \u2013 just at the most recent budget \u2013 allocated another $1.6 billion to western australia for infrastructure and we want to partner closely with the western australian government to deliver on those projects. and that includes 18 quite small-scale projects in the suburbs here in perth as well as some of the large-scale multi-billion dollar projects like metronet. so i\u2019ll be sitting down with minister rita today and going through some of these projects, working on the timeframes and seeing where we can really accelerate them and just get cracking. it's good for the economy and it's good for commuters. gareth parker: there was a lot of stuff promised at that smaller scale during the election campaign, not all that stuff is presently in the budget. so what you do about funding those things? alan tudge: yeah, so from our perspective it's all in the budget. we allocated the funding in this year's budget in april and the election commitments which we made come out of that bucket of money. the state government \u2013 to their credit \u2013 in their budget they actually matched the funding in most of the ones which we\u2019d announced pre going into the campaign. and i'll obviously have a discussion with the minister in relation to the other ones which they haven't yet funded, but obviously we want them to be funded. gareth parker: because you can, i mean it's a tough ask to ask them to fund them before they know what they are in a campaign because the budget came out before the campaign. alan tudge: yeah, that\u2019s right. gareth parker: so if they can\u2019t come up with the money what happens? are they delayed or what? alan tudge: well let's work through that today and that's the discussion that i want to have with my counterpart at the state level. we have a very good relationship, we do a lot of projects jointly and we're very keen to work cooperatively with them, work through each one of these projects, where are the issues and get cracking. i think the public want us to work cooperatively together and to get a better outcome the end of the day. gareth parker: i think that last point is an important one and i think that the one thing that your government's re-election has done is it gives us a bit of clear air for a while. alan tudge: yeah. gareth parker: you got three years. the state labor government have got two years. you've told us that you get on well with your state counterpart. my information from her office is that they see it that way as well. so have we got an opportunity to actually get some stuff done here? alan tudge: absolutely, absolutely. we really want to get cracking on these things. we've already got a lot of projects as you know underway. so you know metronet\u2019s going well, we\u2019ll soon have the rail link out to the airport and other stages are progressing as well. but i particularly want to discuss with her these smaller-scale projects because they're the ones, they might only be five million dollars or ten million dollars\u2019 worth \u2013 but you can really get cracking immediately on those and hopefully get them done in the next couple of years. we've also got three big level crossings as well at oats street, at mint street, at welshpool road. we want to get cracking on those. they\u2019re the types of projects that are small enough in scope, but still create jobs and make a big difference to people's lives when you get rid of those level crossings. daniel andrews \u2013 the state premier in victoria where i'm from \u2013 has done that very well and it does make a big difference and let's do that here as well. gareth parker: it\u2019s tough to rush a billion dollar rail line isn't it? but in saying that, you can bring those things forward more quickly. alan tudge: yeah, correct. i mean those large billion-dollar projects such as railway lines and the big freeways or the big roads; they do take a bit of time. there\u2019s scoping work, there\u2019s planning, sometimes there's some land acquisition. but some of these other smaller projects we do just want to, you know, hit the ground running. let\u2019s get them done quickly. gareth parker: when it comes to infrastructure funding, the typical way that things have been done is that state and federal governments partner up, sometimes it's 50/50, sometimes it's 80/20 whatever, the money is there and that's it. in other states they've gone down the path of things like public-private partnerships. they've also done things like toll roads. is that something you'd like to see west australian governments explore? alan tudge: it\u2019s really up to the state government in terms of those decisions. certainly, you know, again in melbourne, we\u2019ve had toll roads since \u2013 what has it been \u2013 since the 1990s. but it does become expensive for some commuters if you're taking those major roads day in, day out. now obviously commuters ideally wouldn't pay the tolls and that would be their preference. but ultimately that's going to be up to the state government. gareth parker: so it's not something you'll sort of insist on to, as an attachment to any commonwealth funding for future projects? alan tudge: no, we don't have those in our plans. i mean, our major contributions, to be honest, here in western australia is rail projects rather than roads, although we do have major road projects as well. a lot of those major road projects are actually out in the regions like the bunbury ring road or the albany ring road and that sort of stuff, and you\u2019re never going to be putting tolls on those. gareth parker: so you\u2019re not going to get the volume of traffic to make it pay anyway? alan tudge: no, i mean, to be honest, the tolls in melbourne and sydney are often with some of the big tunnelling work, which you\u2019re talking about $5 or $10 billion tunnels, whereas it's very hard to fund completely from the public purse and so the state governments then tend to look for a private contribution and ask for a fee from the commuters that use it. gareth parker: okay. one of the things in terms of trying to get this pump primed, so to speak\u2026 alan tudge: yeah. gareth parker: \u2026to get things moving quickly, one of the things that's been raised with me is that for some projects you've got to get federal environmental approval. i mean, there\u2019s a lot of red tape, green tape that you\u2019ve got to tick through and we talk about that a lot. but it's been raised with me that one of the challenges that the state has is sometimes they run into big delays with the federal regulator. for example, i think the kalamunda road and roe highway project, where there's an intersection upgrade, that has actually led to substantive delays as a result of things not being able to move through that federal approval process quickly. has that been raised with you before? alan tudge: yeah, it has. people have raised this with me and obviously we want to have strict environmental standards but within those standards go through the approval process as quickly as possible. that's the ideal. and certainly \u2013 and the treasurer josh frydenberg was making comments about this just yesterday \u2013 that reflecting on the united states, where the united states, part of the way that they grew their economy so well was a) through tax cuts but b) through deregulating, getting rid of some of that red tape. and so, if that falls into that category and it is a way for us to make the process more efficient, then let's do it. gareth parker: yeah. as a sort of, at the national view, well i mean, what are your priorities in this area? we've talked about roads and rail but your portfolio is also population, cities. i think we've talked about this on the program before. there's obviously been a big debate in melbourne and sydney, which are big cities, really big cities, and they're growing rapidly and it's causing a lot of problems for people who live there. in this state, since the end of the mining construction boom, the reverse has been true. people have been leaving. if anything traffic's probably improved. i think, if they're honest, perth people would acknowledge that. but it's caused its own problems with house prices, for example\u2026 alan tudge: \u2026house prices particularly, that flow through to consumption and all sorts of things. gareth parker: yeah. have you made any progress on this idea of trying to somehow decentralize the population growth? alan tudge: yeah, we have and it is a particular problem in melbourne and sydney and south-east queensland, where three quarters of our population growth of the entire country goes to those three areas. melbourne is just going gangbusters from a population perspective, growing at 2.7 per cent per annum which is a very, very fast growth off a big base. perth you're right. perth does go up and down because it really is more of a, i suppose, a boom-bust economy is how many economists would say, and when it's going well, you tend to get a big inflow of people and vice versa. what we're trying to do \u2013 and this kicks in from 1 july \u2013 is a) we've just slowed down the immigration rate slightly but b) we've actually created dedicated positions \u2013 23,000 \u2013 for the smaller cities and the regions for new people to come into the country and take those positions, and we think that will have an important role to play. in addition to that, international students, are actually a very big part of our temporary migration scheme and we're creating some incentives for international students to consider coming to a perth or an adelaide or a regional university rather than, as presently occurs, 80 per cent go to melbourne, sydney and brisbane. international students are great for a local economy as well because not only are they paying full fees there, but then they're spending a lot of money while they\u2019re there. their parents typically come in and visit, helping tourism and the like. so that's another big thing that kicks in very shortly as well. gareth parker: okay. on more generally, are you surprised the labor party is sort of standing in the way of your tax cut plan? alan tudge: very surprised, i mean, this was central to the election. i mean, the election largely was around two competing versions of tax, and the labor party wanted to increase tax and punish aspiration. we wanted to support aspiration, and the australian people backed us in and we therefore just want the labor party to recognise the will of the australian people and support our tax plan, as simple as that. gareth parker: i guess the labor party's argument is well can you talk about cutting tax in 2024? it's, you know, it's another election cycle away. it\u2019s six years away, or five years away. no one knows what\u2019s going on then. alan tudge: we took it to the election. gareth parker: so you\u2019ve got the mandate? alan tudge: the entire package, we took to the election. everyone understood that. they took an alternative and the australian people voted for ours. now, you know, the labor party down the track, if they want to reverse those tax cuts and put up taxes again, good luck to them. but back the package now is our argument. gareth parker: okay. your colleague, the assistant treasurer michael sukkar, how often do you see him? alan tudge: oh, very regularly because he's right next door to me from an electorate perspective. gareth parker: right-o. can you put in a word for us? we\u2019d like to talk to him. we're trying to get him on an issue that's running here about retirees who have lost their homes, lost their savings, and asic i don't think have done a very good job. alan tudge: yeah, okay. gareth parker: so we're working on it, but if you could put in a word for us. alan tudge: okay. let me have a chat to him. gareth parker: that would be very helpful. alan tudge: i shall do. gareth parker: alan tudge, thank you for your time. alan tudge: absolute pleasure. gareth parker: federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge.

australian budget also includes funding for the final, 10.5\u00a0kilometre stage of the north-south corridor, the largest transport infrastructure project in south australia. it brings the total state and federal commitments to $5.4\u00a0billion, with planning for this final section well underway. the morrison government has committed more than $8.4\u00a0billion for road and rail infrastructure

milestone with the first of the new venue\u2019s 36 unique roof trusses being carefully lifted into place. when complete, the roof, with its design inspired by the pandanus plant, will ensure the stadium becomes recognisable around the world. premier annastacia palaszczuk inspected construction progress today with federal member for herbert philip thompson, member for townsville scott stewart, member for thuringowa aaron harper as well as mayor jenny hill. the premier said the complex design of the stadium\u2019s roof had not been attempted before on such a scale. \u201cthe horseshoe-shaped roof will cover about 75 per cent of the stadium\u2019s 25,000 seats, all of which offer a fantastic experience for fans,\u201d she said. \u201cconstruction is on budget and on track for the stadium to open in time for the 2020 nrl season opener, which is a credit to the contractor and to the local workforce. \u201cit\u2019s also been great to learn in the last week that sir elton john will play here as part of celebrations ahead of next year\u2019s opening match.\u201d the premier said the north queensland stadium would be a proud sport and entertainment centrepiece for the city. \u201cthis is a stadium being built by locals creating much needed jobs in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cmore than 91 per cent workers inducted to the site live in north queensland and more than 97 per cent of construction hours have been completed by local sub-contractors. \u201clocal businesses have been awarded over $139 million in trade packages, and there have been 461 local businesses engaged in the extended supply chain.\u201d the premier also announced that a local firm would deliver the pitch works package which includes one of the most important elements of the new stadium \u2013 the cowboys\u2019 home turf. \u201ctoday i can announce that townsville\u2019s mendi group, which employs 70 locals, been awarded the pitch works trade package for the stadium,\u201d she said. federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge also welcomed the milestone. \u201cwith $100 million of federal funding the morrison government is proud to be helping to deliver this world-class stadium which will be attended by townsville families for generations to come,\u201d mr tudge said. minister for housing and public works mick de brenni said the north queensland stadium had a 97 per cent local workforce building the new home of the north queensland cowboys. \u201cfrom concrete pumping and pitch construction to landscaping this stadium is being built by a local workforce of cowboys fans,\u201d mr de brenni said. \u201cthe state of the art lay and play field will make every cowboys game unmissable, and ensure an elton john concert the week before

director jeff doyle said the stadium had been a boon for his business, which had been working on site since 2017. \u201csince we began on-site, we have been able to employ an additional 23 staff, including 6 apprentices and trainees,\u201d he said. \u201cthis ongoing work has provided great security of employment for our local workforce who are now upskilling in new areas, and we have also been able to engage our local supply chain by offering components of our work to other local subcontractors and suppliers.\u201d other major works being conducted on-site include upper seating bowl platforms in the eastern stand, as well as services cabling, external fa\u00e7ade work and glazing for windows and doors in the eastern stand. member for thuringowa aaron harper said he couldn't wait

"], "our-future-infrastructure-landscape": ["12 June 2019", "it is a pleasure to join you here in melbourne at the australian financial review national infrastructure summit. i am born and bred of this great city.\u00a0 i grew up in pakenham, 55\u00a0kilometres out from where we are today. when i was a boy, it was a country town of just a few thousand people; the local hospital where i was born was then called the pakenham bush nursing hospital. no one would call pakenham \u201cthe bush\u201d anymore.\u00a0 as melburnians know, there are suburbs all the way to pakenham and beyond.\u00a0 the town itself is 50,000 people with another 20,000 on its way. i mention this story because it illustrates the incredible growth of this city over the last few decades; growth which has been largely replicated in our other big cities.\u00a0 this has made our cities more cosmopolitan, vibrant, and wealthier, but it has also created enormous challenges, particularly the challenge of congestion. in the last decade or so, our large cities of melbourne, sydney and brisbane have seen congestion markedly increase.\u00a0 for example, 10 years ago, a 30km freeway journey in melbourne's morning peak took an average of 39 minutes.\u00a0 today, it takes an hour.\u00a0 peak hour is extending; freeways are now frequently at a stand-still; many trains are at crush capacity; and station carparks are full.\u00a0 congestion was a key theme in the recent election, particularly for those in middle and outer suburbs.\u00a0 it impacts people's lives in a real way on a daily basis. but congestion is also an economic burden.\u00a0 when roads are congested, it costs more to transport goods, for service providers to get to their destination, and for employees to get to work. large cities will always have some congestion, but analysis from the bureau of infrastructure, transport and regional economics shows that the avoidable costs of congestion for australia's capital cities has risen significantly over time from a cost of $5.7\u00a0billion per year in 1990, $9.3\u00a0billion in 2000 and $25\u00a0billion in 2017\u201318. it suggests that without any policy change, it will grow to $40\u00a0billion per year by 2030. the governor of the reserve bank of australia also emphasised this point in his most recent speech, pointing out that our infrastructure investment is one of the key factors supporting the economy: the investment [in infrastructure] is important. it is not only supporting demand in the economy at a time when this is needed, but it is also adding to the supply capacity of the economy and directly improving people's lives, including through a reduction in transport congestion. it is these social and economic costs of congestion, and the importance of infrastructure to the economy generally, that have been at the forefront of our minds in establishing our national urban infrastructure agenda (which i will come to in a minute). this infrastructure agenda is one element of a multi-faceted plan to better manage our future population growth\u2014which has the aim of supporting economic growth and maintaining the liveability of our cities and regions.\u00a0 that plan was outlined just a couple of months before the election and comprises three broad components: in my remaining time today, i want to take you briefly through these components of our population plan and how they fit together, with a focus on our infrastructure agenda and how we are thinking about the implementation challenges post election. the first element of our population plan is to ease the population pressure on our big cities and better support the growth of our regions and smaller capitals. australia's population story is one of strong growth. australia, along with new zealand and israel, has some of the highest population growth rates in the developed world, with australia averaging about 1.6 percent per annum. this growth would be challenging enough for planning and infrastructure to keep up, but it hides the fact that 75 percent of all that growth in recent years has been to three areas: melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. those cities have had exceptionally fast growth. melbourne grew by a rapid 2.7 per cent in 2016\u201317, with sydney and seq not far behind. only two other cities in the english speaking world added more people than melbourne during that year: atlanta and houston. around sixty per cent of all our population growth has been driven by migration, but it is even higher in melbourne and sydney. outside of our largest urban areas there are many smaller cities and territories that are growing more modestly but want to grow faster, and in some cases cannot find people for the work available. south australia, for example, wants to grow faster and bridge the gap between its current population growth of 0.7 per cent per year and the national average of 1.6 per cent. in the regions today, there are an estimated 60,000 vacant positions\u201418 per cent more than two years ago. i have mayors and businesses screaming for more people in those areas. in response to this, we are implementing a much more nuanced approach to australia's migration policy, in close consultation with the states and local government.\u00a0 we have also announced a fast rail plan which will work in concert with these new migration settings to help decentralise our population. step 1 is reducing the permanent migration cap from 190,000 to 160,000 people per annum.\u00a0 then, within this 160,000 cap, we have allocated 23,000 places specifically for areas outside the large capital cities.\u00a0 on top of this, we have provided new incentives for international students to seek opportunities in smaller cities or the regions.\u00a0 international students are the largest component of the temporary migrant intake, but like with permanent migrants, 80 percent go to melbourne, sydney and brisbane.\u00a0 our new incentives will change this distribution, without jeopardizing one of our largest export industries. we are also expanding the use of designated area migration agreements.\u00a0 these are tailored migration agreements for specific geographical areas. six are presently being implemented or negotiated. working in concert with these new migration settings is our fast rail plan.\u00a0 our fast rail plan has the same objective as the new migration settings that i have outlined. that is, to take the pressure off the big capitals and support the growth of the regions. over the next two decades, our ambition is to have several of melbourne's, sydney's and brisbane's satellite cities connected to fast rail.\u00a0 this would then enable people to live in a place like shepparton or wodonga (with the cheaper housing and lifestyle that accompanies regional centres) while being able to easily commute daily to the larger employment markets. we are starting with melbourne to geelong and have allocated $2\u00a0billion to get this going and create a 30 minute commute.\u00a0 we are then funding a number of business cases on other routes to determine future priorities.\u00a0 our large capitals will continue to grow strongly but the combination of these migration settings, fast rail to satellite cities and further investment in regional centres will see a slightly more even distribution of population growth. the second part of our population plan is a massive increase in infrastructure expenditure, particularly in urban areas where the population is growing rapidly. in the 2019/20 budget, we announced a record investment of $100\u00a0billion over ten years that benefits every state and territory. in the three years before we came to office, the federal infrastructure expenditure averaged $6\u00a0billion per annum; it is now averaging over $10\u00a0billion across the forward estimates. the bulk of the funding is on the large city-shaping road and rail projects along with key national roads of strategic importance (which the deputy prime minister has referred to). in the budget, for example, we made additional commitments to m1 motorway in queensland, the pacific motorway in new south wales, the western highway in victoria, and the north south corridor in south australia, among others. further rail investments were made in fast rail (as i have mentioned) as well as an additional $700\u00a0million to improve services through to waurn ponds in suburban geelong. however, in the last two budgets, we have also focussed more on suburban roads, in recognition that it is often the local road, intersection, or lack of bridge that causes as much of a congestion headache as the pace of the freeway. we have allocated $3\u00a0billion out of our $4\u00a0billion urban congestion fund, to more than 160 projects across our major cities. these projects are aimed at reducing congestion, helping reduce vehicle operating costs and delivering a more reliable road network for commuters and freight. part of this $4\u00a0billion urban congestion fund is $500\u00a0million allocated for commuter car parks. over the next few years, this funding will add capacity to 47 commuter carparks in melbourne, sydney and brisbane, removing up to 25,000 cars from our roads every day. in many cases, we have targeted entire rail corridors to add parking capacity all the way up the line.\u00a0 we want to get cracking on all of these projects as quickly as possible. in nearly all cases, this involves working cooperatively with state governments and local councils who will undertake the construction, even if the federal government has fully funded the project. i have been having meetings with my state counterparts and local mayors to get these projects locked into construction schedules and delivered as quickly as possible. the public want the levels of government to work together to get projects delivered and that is exactly what we want to do, regardless of the political colour of the government or council. we have done this effectively across the nation, but as our investment increases, naturally our engagement will also.\u00a0 our aim is to develop strong partnerships as we continue to roll out projects. further, how we design the new roads and commuter car parks is often as important as the funding itself.\u00a0 we want to continue to engage with the private sector who bring expertise in the planning and design as well as good public consultation which councils and state governments are generally good at. our national infrastructure program is already having an impact on the economy and will continue to do so. ernst and young, in analysis commissioned by the federal infrastructure department, estimates that our investment in 90 federally funded major projects are, each year, adding $3\u00a0billion to national productivity, saving 225\u00a0million passenger hours, and 55\u00a0million freight and business hours. in further new analysis, they state that the economic gains of these projects are long lasting.\u00a0 by 2036, the economy will be $8.3\u00a0billion permanently larger as a result of these projects in our pipeline.\u00a0 in addition, this pipeline of projects, once complete, will have generated more than 9600 permanent jobs (on top of the tens of thousands of jobs generated during project delivery nationwide). this demonstrates the significant, lasting impact of good infrastructure investment that remains long after the opening. people are also starting to see the changes on the ground from state and federal investments in our cities and will see even more changes in the near future. in brisbane, for example, the $1\u00a0billion gateway north project was opened by premier palaszczuk and myself just a few months ago, allowing 83,000 road users to travel more seamlessly between nudgee and deagon, and reduce congestion on the connection to the bruce highway. as well, next year, two upgraded sections of the m1 pacific motorway will be opening, at the gateway motorway merge and between mudgeeraba and varsity lakes, reducing congestion along the heavily trafficked route between brisbane and the gold coast. in sydney, the city will be transformed within two or three years as some of the massive projects from the huge nsw infrastructure program will be completed, while others are just getting started.\u00a0 for example, the $3\u00a0billion north connex will open next year, along with the next stage of the $16.8\u00a0billion westconnex project (the new m5). the state-funded light rail to randwick will be open at the end of the year.\u00a0 this is on top of the northwest metro that opened last month and had 130,000 passengers on its first day of opening, taking massive pressure off the road network, including major arteries like the m2 motorway. in perth, we are partnering with the state government to deliver the transformational metronet project, which will construct approximately 70\u00a0kilometres of new heavy passenger rail and up to 18 new rail stations. this represents the single largest investment in public transport in perth's history and will make a huge difference in the lives of perth's residents. of the big cities, my main concern over the medium term is melbourne. the victorian government has initiated many large-scale projects that will help transform the city, but most are still five, ten or more years away from completion. metro rail which is critical to enable more train capacity on the entire network, for example, won't be finished until 2025; melbourne airport rail, which we kicked off with our $5\u00a0billion commitment, will commence construction in 2022; north east link, another great project of which we have allocated $1.75\u00a0billion will open in 2027; and of course, the suburban rail link will take decades. of course, the east west link would have been finished this year (creating a ring-road for melbourne) had it not been cancelled. it still needs to be built and we are willing to fund the entire government requirement. this is not to say that nothing has been completed. many projects have, including the widening of the tullamarine and the monash (both supported by the federal government) and an impressive level-crossing removal program.\u00a0 however, the multi-billion dollar large scale projects are all some time away, while many of sydney's are approaching completion. we are in this situation in melbourne in part because the population growth well outstripped expectations. in 2004, for example, it was projected that melbourne would grow by 500,000 by 2017; it in fact grew by 1.2\u00a0million. given the time schedules involved in the larger scale projects, it means it is even more essential to get fast traction on the smaller ones. it will also mean continued monitoring of population growth into the city through our new population planning framework which i will now discuss. the final major element of our plan to better manage our future population growth is a better planning framework with the states and territories. last december, the prime minister led a discussion with states and territory leaders who have now all agreed to develop a national population and planning framework. the framework will provide greater transparency and coordination around population growth and management, consider jurisdiction's input into migration settings, improve population data sharing, and focus on skills requirements at a regional level. we are continuing to develop this framework with the states and territories and welcome input on it from the broader community. our population plans will also be supported in the future by a new centre for population. this will be established from 1 july this year and be based in treasury, where the population portfolio is led from.\u00a0 the centre will help all levels of government and the community better understand how the populations of our states, cities and regions are changing and the challenges that change presents. we will also continue to deliver on our city deals, which have become an important mechanism for developing 10\u201320 year plans across three levels of government for a specific geographical area. we already have seven deals signed and are in the implementation phase of them. just before the election campaign we announced our intention to negotiate a south east queensland deal, while during the campaign we announced two for melbourne: a south east melbourne deal and a north west melbourne deal. all three will be large and complex, but have the potential to better support the growth and liveability of these fast growing regions. we know that having the right infrastructure in place to support the right number of people and skills, aligned with effective governance and collaboration by all levels of government, is essential to continuing to build the success of australia's cities as great places to live and work. we will be looking to identify, and where appropriate, leverage the important connections between our population plan, our approach to cities and the funding we provide to support new infrastructure in future city deals. to conclude my remarks today, i want to reaffirm our top priority, which is to progress the significant commitments we have made on population, infrastructure and cities policy. our direction is clear, and we will work closely with state and local governments to achieve our shared objectives of improving the lives of all australians, taking pressure off our major cities while supporting growth in our regions, and getting people home sooner and safer. thank you.

not need to tell this audience how important the property sector is to australia\u2019s economy, with more than half of australia\u2019s wealth held in residential real estate\u2014 $7.6 trillion worth \u2014 and a further $1 trillion in commercial real estate. the property industry is australia\u2019s largest, generating 13 per cent of gdp or over 200 billion dollars, and supporting 1,400,000 employees. our government understands this deeply.\u00a0 we understand that business growth is the backbone of our economy.\u00a0 this is why we have cut company and small business taxes. it is one reason why we have a record $75 billion investment in infrastructure because the roads and rail are what enables businesses to get around our cities and the nation. it is also why we so strongly believe in stable housing policy. if nothing else, i want you to leave this lunch today, knowing one thing: the coalition government will not be getting rid of negative gearing. and nor will we be massively increasing capital gains taxes.\u00a0 this would cause untold damage to the economy and hurt millions of australians.\u00a0 as the treasurer repeatedly says, under such policies, \u201cif you own a house, it will be worth less; if you rent a house, you will pay more\u201d. yet this is precisely what labor is promising for the property sector and for everyday home owners and renters.\u00a0 it is important that i express this up front, because there is an enormous amount at stake here: for your industry, for the economy and for everyday australians. i would like to focus most of my remarks today, however, on population policy. it has been an issue that we have been discussing all week and continues today with new abs projections on the front pages of the papers this morning.\u00a0 of course, it is very important for your industry as a major driver of your growth. i would like to explain why we are discussing population policy, and the key elements to our plan.\u00a0 we are carefully aiming to strike the right balance between maximising our economic potential while maintaining our liveability. to start, we know that population growth is an important contributor to economic growth, both in absolute terms and on a per-capita basis. treasury estimated in 2015 that population factors contributed about a fifth of our increase in wealth per person over the previous four decades, mainly by growing the working age share of the population. but, we are also aware of the challenges that unbalanced and unplanned population growth presents, particularly in the form of congestion.\u00a0 this is being felt acutely in melbourne and sydney in particular, and is why it has been a central issue in the victorian election. let me first take you through some of the numbers which put this in context. australia\u2019s population is growing fast presently at about 1.6 per cent per annum.\u00a0 this is more than double the rate of the growth of the united states and almost 2\u00bd times the oecd average.   it is also fast by historical standards.\u00a0 there have only been two other times since 1900 when we have grown as quickly: briefly in the 1920s and during the \u201cpopulate or perish\u201d policy post world war ii. sixty per cent of this growth has been due to international migration (with the rest coming from natural increase). this kind of rapid growth would present enough of a challenge for governments and town planners, even with all other factors remaining equal. but two factors have made it particularly challenging.\u00a0 first, the distribution of that growth has not been uniform. if it was, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. \u00a0 rather, melbourne, sydney and south east queensland have been growing exceptionally fast - accounting for 75 per cent of our entire population growth - while other parts of the country have minimal population growth and many are crying out for more people. melbourne grew by an incredible 2.7 per cent last year, with sydney and seq not far behind.\u00a0 only two other cities in the english speaking world added more people than melbourne last year: atlanta and houston.\u00a0 not new york, not la, not chicago, not london nor any of the other great international cities. sixty five per cent of that growth was driven by migration, and in sydney the figure was even higher, at 83 per cent.\u00a0 of australia\u2019s new arrivals, only about 25 per cent of permanent visas were employer sponsored where people came because of a job to go to. but while we have had exceptional population growth in melbourne and sydney, there are many smaller cities and territories that are growing more modestly but want to grow faster, and in some cases cannot find people for the work available. in the regions today, there are an estimated 47,000 vacant positions - 18 per cent more than two years ago.\u00a0 i have mayors and businesses screaming for more people in those areas. the second factor that has made our growth challenging is that it was well above expectations.\u00a0 in 2002, for example, the intergenerational report suggested that australia would grow by 2.5 million by 2017.\u00a0 we in fact grew by 5 million people. in 2004, the abs projected that my home town, melbourne, would grow by 500,000 by 2017. it grew by 1.2 million. so we have had fast growth; we have had concentrated growth; and we have had growth well above projections without the infrastructure and services keeping up.\u00a0 and this has contributed to the immense congestion we are currently facing in our two big capitals and to a lesser extent in south east queensland and elsewhere. how were the projections so wrong? in large part, because in 2007, prime minister rudd almost doubled the migration intake overnight. no warning, no consultation. there was not even a clear public announcement of the changes. but it lead to an extra 100,000 people annually for the next few years, most of whom went to melbourne and sydney. so while a city or state may have been planning for a certain degree of growth, it all of a sudden had nearly twice that figure.\u00a0 it was a breakdown in planning and it reveals one of the core structural problems with our federation and how we manage population and plan better.\u00a0 that is, that we at the federal level largely control the population growth lever - through migration - while the states, territories and local councils have primary responsibility for delivering the infrastructure, housing approvals, schools, hospitals and other services. here in sydney, you actually had the two levels of governments working in opposite directions in the early to mid-2000s.\u00a0 you had premier bob carr who famously said that \u201csydney was full\u201d and was consequently not building the infrastructure for the future, while just a few years later, kevin rudd became pm and turbo-charged the population growth into sydney.\u00a0 the infrastructure couldn\u2019t keep up; the housing approvals couldn\u2019t keep up. much of the congestion in sydney over the last decade has been the result of this. it has been the result of poor planning and state and federal governments in the past working in opposite directions. the nsw government is doing incredible work in catching up on the required infrastructure - with a massive $87 billion in expenditure over the next four years alone. this is aided by record federal funding supporting key projects such as the northconnex and westconnex. but it should have occurred a decade ago, preferably before the massive population growth, not after it. in melbourne, the infrastructure similarly hasn\u2019t kept up. melbourne still doesn\u2019t have an effective ring road because daniel andrews cancelled the east west link (and wasted more than $1.3 billion in doing so); there is still no rail to australia\u2019s largest university campus in clayton; and a rail link to the airport will only occur because we have forced the state government into it by putting $5 billion on the table. our plan will avoid this situation happening again by strongly linking population growth to infrastructure, service and housing approval capacity. by doing this, we can grow sustainably, maintain our liveability and bring the australian public with us. how will this occur? as prime minister morrison has outlined, we are going to take a bottom-up approach to migration settings, rather than the top-down approach that has typically characterised the annual migration settings that the federal government determines. each state and territory government is being asked to inform us about their population plans, guided by what their population carrying capacity is for their existing and planned infrastructure and services. this may include a region-by-region analysis of population forecasts and carrying capacities, acknowledging that places like dubbo are struggling to find workers while other places struggle to grow. every region and city is different and we have to be mindful of this. south australia, for example, wants to grow faster by at least 10 to 15,000 per annum.\u00a0 as does the northern territory, tasmania, and large regional areas like the goldfields or western victoria.\u00a0 in many cases, there are already considered population plans in place. these state plans will inform the overall migration levels. \u00a0 we can use visa incentives and conditions to encourage people to the smaller cities and regions that are looking for more people, while easing the pressure on melbourne and sydney while the infrastructure catches up. \u00a0 this is not a radical idea, or somehow unconstitutional, as some suggest. \u00a0to the contrary, we already have geographically specific visas and people adhere to their requirements.\u00a0 if they do not, they put in jeopardy their future stay in australia which is a very powerful motivator!\u00a0 consequently, only 0.2 per cent of those on geographic specific visas breach them. further, when newly arrived migrants go to the smaller cities or regions, they tend to stay there, even after any visa condition has expired.\u00a0 it is important to point out that our approach will recognise the significance of employer-sponsored migration.\u00a0 our government has already tightened these requirements, and we maintain a high vigilance on compliance. but businesses that cannot legitimately find an australian to fill a position, are able to sponsor a person into the country to complete that role. this is vital to ensure that businesses that can\u2019t find the workers they need here in australia can continue to grow and secure our prosperity.\u00a0 i know that this point is particularly important for the property sector. equally, without such employer-sponsored migration, some essential services such as nursing and aged care would struggle to operate. we don\u2019t want to compromise this. however, this does not undermine our fundamental approach, as employer sponsored migration is the minority of our migration intake.\u00a0 indeed, only about 25 per cent of all permanent migration visas issued are employer sponsored.\u00a0 this approach of \u201cbottom-up\u201d analysis will place much more responsibility on the state and territories to properly plan and forecast.\u00a0 it means that they can be rewarded if they speed up their infrastructure delivery and housing approval processes.\u00a0 because then they will be able to accommodate faster growth. we are always going to grow, particularly to our big cities, but it must be planned growth where the infrastructure keeps up. our approach will also require more sophisticated forecasting and monitoring against the forecasts.\u00a0 the planning institute of australia notes that there is no consistency across states, between councils and sometimes even between state departments in their population forecasts. in tasmania, they point out that the four economic regions have population forecasts which, when aggregated, are 12 percentage points different to the statewide forecasts. planning for population growth must be a partnership involving all levels of government and close consultation with the private sector. the result of this approach will likely see a reduction in annual national migration levels.\u00a0 but it will also almost certainly see an increase in migration levels for south australia, northern territory, perhaps western australia and those regional areas which are struggling to find workers. other elements of our government\u2019s policy may also see faster growth in different parts of our big cities. congestion in part occurs because jobs and housing are not always in the same place. the western sydney deal, for example, centred around our $5 billion commitment to build a new western sydney airport, will see the construction of 200,000 houses catering for 500,000 people. the aim is to create a new city where people can live, work and play all in that area. i have focused here on the challenges to population growth and our plan to deal with this.\u00a0 but we are also mindful when establishing population policy of two other challenges. first, ensuring that we maintain a balance in our demographics so that we can maximise economic growth and opportunity. the key issue here is ageing.\u00a0 our current fertility rate (1.8 births per woman) is below the replacement level and we are living longer. if we had no migration, we would start to see a decline in population from about 2040. more urgently, our workforce would start to shrink from 2020. we have already seen an increase in the aged-dependency ratio over the decades. in 1974, there were 7.4 people of working age to those above 65.\u00a0 today, it is about 4.3. this needs to be carefully monitored. as you would be aware, a great deal of the public expenditure on individuals occurs in their older age.\u00a0 maintaining healthy dependency ratios are critical. \u00a0 second, ensuring that we maintain social cohesion while growing our population.\u00a0 i have been discussing the challenges we are facing is this area for much of this year, largely in my previous portfolio.\u00a0 we have been tremendously successful in integrating people into our nation, but there are indicators that we are not doing quite as well as we have done in the past.\u00a0 most of you will recall the tragic incident we saw in melbourne just two weeks ago, when a radicalised islamist extremist murdered the much-loved melbourne restauranteur, sisto malaspina, himself an immigrant. this act of terrorism is a stark real-world reminder of the consequences australia will most certainly suffer if, as a nation, we fail to achieve the kind of social cohesion most of us, and indeed, most within the islamic community, are working so hard to maintain. conclusion australia is in the midst of a period quite unlike any other in recent decades. our population is growing at a rapid rate.\u00a0 with that growth comes an extraordinary number of opportunities for our nation. some things we know for sure: australia will continue to grow; that will be through both natural growth and through international migration; and our big cities will continue to attract a large proportion of that growth.\u00a0 but like most opportunities, they come with some serious challenges. challenges that the morrison government is addressing as i have outlined. we will be working with you closely in the weeks and the months ahead as we develop our policy further.\u00a0 to ensure that, finally, population growth is more closely tied to infrastructure and services carrying capacity. we want controlled growth to maximise economic gains without compromising our liveability. we want to ensure that businesses like yours can continue to employ, grow and invest. planned, controlled population growth helps achieve this. lower company, small business and income taxes helps achieve this. record investment in road and rail infrastructure help achieve this. this is our government\u2019s agenda.\u00a0 and the future is bright for the economy, for your industry and for every day australians. thank you. "], "sky-news-live-interview-kieran-gilbert-and-laura-jayes": ["09 April 2019", "kieran gilbert: let\u2019s go live to the population minister alan tudge. melbourne mp alan tudge, your thoughts on where this adani situation is at and whether or not melissa price is holding up the final approvals here? alan tudge:  i think melissa price is just going through a methodical process. so there\u2019s a bunch of environmental approvals which have to be done. she consults with the scientists and she gets advice and then will make the final decision as to whether it can go ahead. now, that takes time, she wants to do it right, it\u2019s a big decision and she\u2019s doing it properly. and so i have full confidence that she\u2019ll make the right decision in the end. laura jayes: how much time does she need? and will that decision be made before you go into caretaker period? alan tudge:  well, i mean the decision is not going to be rushed and i appreciate that some people such as james mcgrath are very passionate about this, and he\u2019s a queenslander and a proud queenslander, and queenslanders want to see this enormous economic opportunity come to fruition. but it does have to go through that process and she is consulting properly and then we\u2019ll make that final decision and you\u2019d have to ask that question when she is likely to make that. kieran gilbert: in relation to the- mcgrath- you say that mcgrath\u2019s passionate about it, obviously he is, he\u2019s saying that if there is not an approval coming that she should be sacked as minister. what do you make of that? because that\u2019s certainly stepping up the pressure on this particular issue. alan tudge:  i know that a lot of the queenslanders in particular are very keen to see this enormous economic opportunity come to fruition. now, the coalition government is very much about supporting jobs growth, about supporting wealth creation and more opportunities for all australians. at the same time, we do have strict environmental standards and we have strict processes which new things like mines have to go through. and that\u2019s exactly the process which is going through at the moment, so let\u2019s just follow that process methodically, calmly and assuredly and let\u2019s see what the answer will be, which the minister will make in due course. laura jayes: with respect, you don\u2019t have that much time to be calm and methodical though, do you? melissa price is looking at this approval; it\u2019s already been approved by her department. approved by her department, so queensland mps are asking what the holdup is and what are they going to sell to their electorates once you get into the campaign proper? alan tudge: well, at the end of the day, this is a- my understanding is that it\u2019s a ministerial decision having received the advice from the department. so she\u2019s taking her time, quite rightly, on a big decision and i have full confidence in her decision-making capabilities. she taking her time, she\u2019s being methodical, she consulting properly before making the decision. kieran gilbert: do you feel that it would have adverse impacts in terms of the politics of your seats in melbourne, your seat of aston and others in nearby electorates? because there is also a sense that josh frydenberg\u2019s been putting pressure on melissa price to not allow the final approval. what\u2019s the view from melbourne on this? alan tudge: i mean all members of the coalition, whether you\u2019d be from queensland or from melbourne or tasmania, want to see more jobs created, want to see more wealth created and you can only do this when you\u2019ve got strong viable growing businesses.\nat the same time, we do have strict legal and environmental frameworks and so we want to see those strict legal environmental frameworks properly adhered to and that\u2019s exactly what is occurring with the adani proposal. there\u2019s a proposal being put forward, the offer is for more jobs, for more economic opportunities but it must go through all those steps. it\u2019s properly going through those steps and it\u2019s now resting with the minister who will be making a decision in due course, and i think that\u2019s the proper process. laura jayes: okay. let\u2019s look at this electric cars policy now. can you please explain the difference between your electric car policy and labor\u2019s? alan tudge: well, what labor is proposing is that people will be forced to buy electric cars within the next decade and whereas we are putting some investments in to try to encourage more innovation and r&d. but i think that\u2019s the key difference, and labor\u2019s proposal basically will mean that cars will become more expensive. and there\u2019s new analysis today from the centre for independent economics which says that the average car will be $5,000 more expensive under labor\u2019s plan. now, that will just put it beyond the reach of many everyday australians and it will also mean particularly those larger vehicles, which are so popular for australians, will be completely out of reach for everyday people. and so we are deeply concerned about that. i don\u2019t think they\u2019ve thought their policy through. we do support electric vehicles, we support people who make their own choice for electric vehicles and we\u2019ll support the r&d in that. but we\u2019re not going to force anybody to make the decision. and we certainly don\u2019t want to see cars to be $5,000 more expensive then what they are today. kieran gilbert: but obviously, this is an evolving technology, isn\u2019t it? do you agree with josh frydenberg who likened evs to the iphone in terms of those who are sceptical about it now will end up buying them, and the fact is that some motoring manufacturers are only going to build electric and hybrid vehicles from 2020, those including jaguar and land rover? that was a point that was made by mr frydenberg last year when he wrote an opinion piece in support of evs. alan tudge: there is no doubt that many people will make a choice to purchase an electric vehicle, as they are doing now and they will do so in the future. but it\u2019s their choice, and it will be in keeping with the technology. i mean, we never forced anybody to buy the iphone - to use the analogy which you were just making - but when the technology is there people started to purchase it \u2026 kieran gilbert: [talks over] yeah, but labor\u2019s not going to force people. it\u2019s a target, they\u2019re setting a target. you're not going to be forced to sell your hilux or hand over your ford ranger. that\u2019s not [indistinct]\u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] well they have- no, well, to be fair, they have not provided that detail. i mean they've made these bold assertions that 50 per cent of all vehicles will be electric in 10 years\u2019 time, which is a completely unrealistic assertion unless you are basically forcing the retailers \u2013 which i understand is what they're proposing \u2013 that the retailers will have to ensure that 50 per cent of their cars which are sold are electric. that is my understanding of the policy. now if they want to come out and say something different they should \u2026 laura jayes: [talks over] it's actually, alan tudge, it\u2019s actually-\u00a0 i think this has been a little bit mixed up in some of the debate, but my understanding of labor's policy is that they want to target of 50 per cent of all new cars to be sold by 2030 to be electric cars. that is firmly in line with the government's goal, isn't it? alan tudge: we want people to be able to make their own decisions in relation to purchasing vehicles, and we want those vehicles to be affordable. and if people want to buy an suv because they've got a family or they want to go camping on the weekends, then good luck to them. whereas the labor policy is going to price those vehicles out of reach of many australians. and as i said earlier, the front page of one of our newspapers today shows that independent economic analysis shows that many vehicles will be up to $5,000 more expensive because of labor's policy. now people won't- many people won't be able to afford that, and particularly those larger cars which are so popular. that's my deep concern about this. not only is it unaffordable for some people, but also i just don't think it's been thought through in terms of having the networks around the country for people to be able to charge it, for people to be able to efficiently be able to \u2013 if they run out of battery power \u2013 to be able to efficiently and quickly get more battery power in. the technology will come eventually, but it's not going to come overnight. kieran gilbert: the environment department though confirmed last week in questioning from kristina keneally that the abatement measures that you are putting in place through various policies \u2013 one which was spruiked just as recently as last week by the member for kooyong, the treasurer mr. frydenberg \u2013 that they do amount to an abate- a target, whether you want to call it a target or not, of up to 50 per cent electric vehicles by 2030. as laura said, it's the same. alan tudge: well, i'll let the environment minister or the energy minister deal with those questions. this is not my portfolio. i am concerned though about the implications of labor's policy of forcing people, forcing the retailers and forcing the manufacturers, to have to sell 50 per cent of their cars being electric when the market is just not there to purchase them. and that means higher prices for everyday consumers when people cannot afford that right now. laura jayes: minister tudge, you\u2019ll be happy to know that kieran and i delved quite deep into the budget papers \u2013 budget paper no. 4 \u2013 and we looked at the overseas net migration figures. it shows not much change over the forward estimates. it showed barely a change in the figures that your government is forecasting. so what is your population policy? is it to reduce or just to disperse? alan tudge: so a population policy actually has a number of parts to it. one is in relation to reducing the overall permanent migration cap, as well as encourage more new migrants out into the regions. two is to invest much more money into congestion-busting infrastructure, including fast rail, to further disperse the populations. and three to have a better planning framework with the states and territories. now in relation to that first part, so yes we have reduced the permanent migration cap from 190,000 down to 160,000. and within that, we've got 23,000 dedicated places which can only be used for the regions and the smaller cities. so that alone will take pressure off the big capital cities, because nearly everybody goes to those big capitals right now, and then those other two elements of the plan complement that. kieran gilbert: alan tudge, thank you, appreciate it. "], "doorstop-interview-berwick-railway-station-melbourne": ["08 April 2019", "jason wood: good morning everyone and welcome to la trobe and in particular here today at berwick train station. it\u2019s great to have the treasurer here, josh frydenberg, and also minister alan tudge. this is actually now probably the fastest growing electorate in the country. previously, to bust congestion, we\u2019ve actually committed back in march 2016, a $1 billion plan to upgrade the monash freeway. the great news is stage one has been completed, that was an extra lane from clyde road to the south gippsland highway. stage two is about to start, that is an extra lane from warrigal road to the south gippsland highway. and, here, on clyde road right out to kardinia and potentially even right out to pakenham. the treasurer will be very excited about the beaconsfield interchange and the extension of o\u2019shea road and the simple reason is because south of the beaconsfield interchange, it\u2019s going to create 10,000 local innovation, advanced manufacturing jobs. now, one of the biggest issues in my electorate has been is people trying to get to work on time and coming to the berwick train station and other local train stations, even at 6.00am in the morning, they can\u2019t find a car park. so, rather than starting the morning in a relaxed fashion, it ends up being a very stressful event, driving around berwick or driving around pakenham train stations to find a car-parking spot. so, with this great news in the federal budget and i thank both the treasurer and minister alan tudge, of a $500 million fund for local train stations, this is fantastic news for local residents here living in la trobe and in particular, today in berwick, where we are going to announce $15 million for up to five hundred new car parking places. thank you very much, treasurer. josh frydenberg:well, thanks very much jason and can i congratulate you on being an outstanding local member for the people of la trobe and it\u2019s good to be here with you at berwick train station. and also the expertise you bring to the parliament, having been a former police officer and somebody who is very, very focused on fighting terrorism. to my good friend and parliamentary colleague, alan tudge, alan has put together an incredible package of measures to bust congestion in our cities and to manage population growth. we know it all too well here in victoria and in melbourne, a city that is growing by a couple thousand people a week, putting real pressure on public transport, on our health and our education services. so, busting congestion, getting people home sooner so they can be around the dinner table and getting them to work earlier has been a real focus of this budget. and this is a budget that will build a stronger economy and secure a better future for all australians. of course, it\u2019s the first budget surplus in more than a decade. but a strong economy is not an end in itself, it\u2019s a means to an end and that end is to guarantee the essential services of health and education and disability support and aged care, but it\u2019s also a means to an end of providing the cities that we live in, the regions that we live in with the best possible infrastructure. and so in this budget, we announced $4 billion for our urban congestion fund and that is going to be absolutely critical to ease the pressures on people living in our cities and our regions. and a component of that is a $500 million car park commuter fund and this is the first project under this fund. so, i think it\u2019s going to be really important, it\u2019s going to create more car parks here, so people don\u2019t have to drive all the way into work. it will take cars off the roads, thousands of cars off the road and, importantly, it will give people the peace of mind when they catch the train to work they can put their car here and that they don\u2019t have to drive all the way into work. so, it\u2019s a great announcement, it\u2019s a real credit to jason and his advocacy and to alan who is behind this program. alan tudge:well, thanks, treasurer and jason. today, we are announcing $15 million, which is the first project we are funding out of the new $500 million commuter carpark fund. now, that fund will finance up to fifty stations, up to fifty carparks and take more than 25,000 cars off the road. now, that is real congestion busting infrastructure. we know that people want to be able to take the train and we support their choice. but to do so, they need to be able to find a car park readily and if they find a car park readily they can get onto that, jump on the train and get in to work quickly and back home at night quickly, cheaply and safely and that\u2019s what we want to do. this $500 million is part of a broader $4 billion urban congestion fund. and that is part of a massive $100 billion infrastructure program, which we are rolling out over the next decade, the largest in australia\u2019s history. of course, we have announced $6.2 billion more for victoria alone and that is going towards our growth corridors, it\u2019s going towards things like the airport rail, to fast rail to geelong, to sealing the dandenong range and of course, also, projects like this one. we want to bust congestion with the major corridor upgrades, we want to bust congestion by fixing those local intersections, which cause people so much grief. but, we also want to bust congestion by providing commuter carparks which people can get to and then jump on the train to get to work quickly and to get home safely at night. i want to thank jason for his advocacy of this project, along with the local casey council, who has been a very strong advocate of this project as well. i was just speaking to someone this morning, and they were saying that this carpark was full when they had arrived 8.06am in the morning. and we want to add up to 500 new car parks here, so that people can get on the train quickly, get to work and get back home safely at night. we\u2019re happy to take any questions. question:just a question for mr. frydenberg. just on another note\u2026 josh frydenberg:any questions about the infrastructure? just underline what alan said and what jason has been saying. $100 billion set out in this budget for our ten-year infrastructure plan. importantly, for the people of victoria, they\u2019re going to see fast rail, which is going to bust the congestion in the city, it\u2019s going to unlock the potential of the regions, we\u2019re getting the melbourne airport rail link and we\u2019re getting practical projects that make a difference to people\u2019s lives, like here at berwick station.

infrastructure because we have ran a strong economy and we have got a budget surplus. as the treasurer and the prime minister have been saying, a budget surplus is not an end to itself, it\u2019s there for a purpose and it means when you\u2019ve got a strong budget position you can invest in these congestion busting infrastructure projects, you can invest in rail links across the country, you can invest in massive road projects to make roads safer and better for everybody \u2013 that\u2019s good for families, that\u2019s good for businesses, that\u2019s good for the economy and it\u2019s good for australia. i am happy to take any questions on this. journalist: minister, why is so much of the infrastructure funding put off into the forward years (inaudible) on fast rail, 1.95 of that out of the $2 billion that\u2019s come down from 22/23. why is that money not coming earlier? alan tudge: as soon as the state government is willing to build that fast rail our money will be there. we\u2019ve made the commitment of putting $2 billion on the table as an indication that we want to get the melbourne to geelong fast rail done. and it will be the first fast rail project in australia\u2019s history and it will enable the train to go from geelong to melbourne in 32 minutes. that\u2019s our plan. now on all of these projects, they all have a lead-time and in many cases with these large-scale projects they also take many years as well. an example in victoria, which i can provide, is the melbourne airport rail. we announced $5 billion in last year\u2019s budget for the melbourne airport rail, now this year the state government has said \u2018yes, we are willing to match that funding,\u2019 and have signed an agreement to get it going. it will start in 2022 and it will probably take several years to get it built. that $5 billion of our commitment will then be allocated according to the years where it is needed. because we allocated it last year, it forced the state government\u2019s hand, they\u2019re matching it and we are finally going to get it done. had we not done that we\u2019d sill be waiting years for it to be built. journalist: is it not a matter of putting that funding off to 2020/23 so you\u2019re budget surplus- alan tudge: no, not at all. i mean we have so many other projects going on right now, in every single city, in every single state and so this adds to our pipeline of projects. and that\u2019s the nature of these largescale projects. let\u2019s take a look at south australia for example, there\u2019s $3 billion already invested in other parts of the north-south corridor \u2013 that is underway now being spent as we speak. some of those sections will come to a conclusion this year others will come to conclusion in 2022 and that\u2019s when the final section will begin. but because we\u2019ve now got the additional $1.5 billion adding to the already committed $1.2 billion to the final section, that means the state government has got the surety that it can do the planning work, get it going, do the procurement knowing that the money is there. journalist: did the queensland government get overlooked in this budget, they [inaudible] of handing out funds? alan tudge: not at all. i mean, they should look at the budget figures, i said before, queensland\u2019s got $16 billion worth of funding over the next decade including very significant projects, such as further upgrades to the gateway motorway and to the m1. journalist: do you think that this big spend on infrastructure, particularly in the regions is going to be enough to encourage voters to stay with the coalition, rather than turning to minor parties [inaudible]? alan tudge: we\u2019ve been investing in the regions ever since we came to government and we\u2019re able to invest even more now because we\u2019ve been running a strong economy and we\u2019ve got the budget back into surplus. journalist: treasury updated its forecast on wages, saying there wouldn\u2019t be a significant increase to pay packets for at least the next year, isn\u2019t that damaging for you... alan tudge: are there any other questions on infrastructure, otherwise i\u2019ll let those types of questions be dealt with by the treasurer. journalist: [inaudible] is that not damaging for you? alan tudge: say that question again please journalist: treasury updated its forecast on wages, saying it\u2019s very unlikely there would be a substantive increase in pay packets until at least next year, isn\u2019t that damaging going into an election where labor says that this will be a referendum on wages? alan tudge: so the treasurer addressed this particular point at the press club today at lunchtime, he pointed out that the wages index was actually higher than inflation which is good and its forecast to, i think, grow and he said to two and three quarter per cent next year. we want to see higher wages, we want people to have more money in their pockets and that\u2019s why people in low to middle income families are going to get up to a $1080 in their pockets more, come the end of this financial year. journalist: do you have an understanding of why the energy supplement wasn\u2019t given to people [inaudible]? alan tudge: and again, the treasurer addressed this today journalist: so is this not a factor? alan tudge: the treasurer addressed this today "], "building-our-future-delivering-right-infrastructure-growing-nation": ["02 April 2019", "the federal liberal and nationals government is investing a record $100\u00a0billion over 10 years from 2019\u201320 through its rolling infrastructure plan to help manage our growing population, meet our national freight challenge and get australians home sooner and safer. this includes an additional $23\u00a0billion of new funding in the 2019\u201320 budget for projects and initiatives that will benefit every state and territory and provide local job opportunities. our investment builds on generation-defining projects already underway, including the western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport, the inland rail and the long-overdue melbourne airport rail link. since 2013\u201314 we have committed over $145\u00a0billion to new and upgraded road and rail projects across australia, creating more than 50,000 direct and indirect jobs. the 2019\u201320 budget sees additional funding for major projects in every state and territory including: $2\u00a0billion for fast rail between melbourne and geelong in victoria; $1.6\u00a0billion for the m1 pacific motorway extension to raymond terrace in new south wales; $800\u00a0million for queensland's gateway motorway (bracken ridge to pine river); $140\u00a0million for the albany ring road in western australia; $60\u00a0million for tiwi island roads in the northern territory; $1.5\u00a0billion towards the remaining sections of the north-south corridor in south australia; $68\u00a0million for tranche 3 of the tasmanian freight revitalisation program in tasmania; and a $30\u00a0million investment to upgrade the kings highway corridor, improving access between the australian capital territory and nsw. new funding and investment models will generate economic opportunities outside the largest capitals, including through the first regional deals for barkly, hinkler and albury-wodonga; upgrading our regional airports; and delivering the next round of the building better regions fund and stronger communities programme. estimates put the cost of congestion in australia's capital cities at $25\u00a0billion per year, projected to reach $40\u00a0billion by 2030. we want to ensure people spend less time stuck in traffic and more time productively at work or at home with their families and loved ones. this is why we are committing an additional $3\u00a0billion to increase the urban congestion fund to $4\u00a0billion for projects that will directly tackle local traffic bottlenecks. as part of this initiative, the government is also providing $500\u00a0million for a commuter car park fund to make rail networks more accessible and take cars off the road. we are also recognising australia's fastest-growing population centre by committing up to $1.14\u00a0billion to upgrade suburban arterial roads in south-eastern and northern melbourne. the suburban roads upgrades will reduce congestion and increase the safety and reliability of the suburban road network across melbourne's southeast and north. the government will again provide significant investment in rail infrastructure. through our investment in fast rail, we are targeting key corridors to allow people to live in regional centres while enjoying the benefits of our capital cities. we are investing $2\u00a0billion to deliver fast rail between melbourne and geelong and a further $700\u00a0million to improve services through to waurn ponds in suburban geelong, bringing our total commitment for stage 2 and 3 upgrades to $750\u00a0million. a further $40\u00a0million will be invested in five fast rail business cases on corridors between sydney and wollongong, sydney and parkes (via bathurst and orange), melbourne and albury-wodonga, melbourne and traralgon, and brisbane and the gold coast. we have committed funding of $3.5\u00a0billion to improve rail services in western sydney through the western sydney north south rail link package, to ensure that the western sydney international (nancy-bird walton) airport has a rail connection by the time it opens for business in 2026. across the nation, city deals are leveraging a federal liberal and nationals government commitment of more than $5.7\u00a0billion to support productive and liveable cities through a partnership approach with state, territory and local governments. this budget includes additional funding commitments to city deals, bringing the government's contribution to $183.8\u00a0million for the geelong city deal and $174\u00a0million for the adelaide city deal. the 2019\u201320 budget commits an additional $1\u00a0billion to the roads of strategic importance initiative bringing it to $4.5\u00a0billion, helping connect regional businesses to local and international markets, and better connecting regional communities. through this initiative, we are investing in over 25 key freight corridors (including feeder roads critical to the productivity of the corridor) to more efficiently connect agricultural and mining regions to our ports, airports and other transport hubs. this investment is part of the australian government's contribution to the national freight and supply chain strategy and action plan. we are also increasing our investment to improve vital national networks across the nation including $1\u00a0billion for the princes highway, $400\u00a0million for the newell highway in new south wales, as well as funding for regional roads such as $287.2\u00a0million to build the cairns ring road in queensland, $360\u00a0million to complete the duplication of the western highway between ararat and stawell in victoria and $259.8\u00a0million for the south australian rural roads package. in addition to regional roads and rail initiatives, we are committing $100\u00a0million to upgrade regional airports. these airports are vital for our regions, ensuring access to emergency services and providing a link to domestic and international markets and employment opportunities. the regional airports program will ensure airport facilities meet the needs of communities and local industry now and into the future. road crashes cost the national economy about $30\u00a0billion a year, but this figure is far outstripped by the immeasurable suffering of families impacted by road deaths. to help address the epidemic of deaths and serious injuries on our roads, we are establishing a new office of road safety to support greater leadership by the australian government in road safety. the office of road safety will be backed by dedicated new funding including the $4\u00a0million road safety awareness and enablers fund and the $12\u00a0million road safety innovation fund. road safety is everyone's responsibility but all levels of government have a key role to play in delivering safer roads and vehicles. that is why the australian government will deliver an additional $2.2\u00a0billion in road safety funding from 2019\u201320 through the local and state government road safety package. this includes a further $550\u00a0million for the successful black spot program, which targets safety issues on urban and regional roads to reduce serious crashes in these locations by an average of 30 per cent. there is also an additional $275\u00a0million for the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program and $275\u00a0million for the bridges renewal program. as the name suggests, the local and state government road safety package is focused on improving local roads, with $1.1\u00a0billion being provided directly to councils under the roads to recovery program to support vital road maintenance by local governments. this funding will allow local governments to invest in the safety and quality of local roads, especially on local country roads where there is a disproportionate number of deaths and serious accidents. this will also help free up local governments' financial assistance grant funding to be used on other local priorities. we are also providing $2.6\u00a0million to the australian road research board to make professional expertise more readily available to local governments, helping them better understand and assess their road assets. an additional $6\u00a0million will be provided to heavy vehicle safety initiatives, funding more projects to improve the safety of heavy vehicles on our roads. we are also taking practical measures to directly support australia's newest drivers. an additional $8\u00a0million will continue the successful keys2drive program until 2023, allowing the program to continue to focus on improving its reach into regional areas. this funding bolsters other road safety-related measures, including our $6.64\u00a0million commitment to the australasian new car assessment program (ancap) to 2022\u201323. australia's freight system is critical to our economy and way of life. however, the current system is coming under increasing strain with freight volumes expected to nearly double over the next 20 years coupled with significant changes to the nature of the freight task. to help position australia to meet this challenge, the australian government is working across all tiers of government and with industry to deliver a national freight and supply chain strategy and action plan. this will provide an integrated, 20-year vision, coordinating actions to drive real improvements to freight productivity in australia. the strategy extends beyond investment to include regulatory, planning and supply chain reforms necessary to drive the long term improvements needed for australian businesses to remain globally competitive and make sure the aspirations of the australian community are met. in further support of these initiatives, we are committing $8.5\u00a0million to settle the design of a national freight data hub in response to industry calls for better freight data availability and sharing. this includes arrangements for data collection, protection, dissemination and hosting, and the establishment of the freight data exchange pilot to allow access to freight data in real time. through the 2019\u201320 budget we are also contributing $8\u00a0million for the national heavy vehicle regulator to work with local governments to improve road access for heavy vehicles, such as farming and construction machinery. further, we are committing $44\u00a0million to the supporting national freight and supply chain priorities\u2014inland rail interface improvement program to enhance the benefits of inland rail for regional australia and the national freight network. in addition, we have committed up to $20\u00a0million to jointly fund two business cases for intermodal terminals in melbourne and brisbane capable of supporting the inland rail. the 2019\u201320 budget continues to build a strong regional australia through extensions to community grants programs that invest directly in economic and social infrastructure that creates jobs and builds stronger regional communities. the government has allocated a further $200\u00a0million towards a fourth round of the building better regions fund, bringing the total commitment for this program to $841.6\u00a0million from 2017\u201318 to 2022\u201323. this highly successful fund supports regional and remote communities by funding investment-ready infrastructure projects that create jobs and drive economic growth. the budget also continues to back our regions with $22.7\u00a0million to deliver a fifth round of the stronger communities programme, bringing the total commitment to $103.9\u00a0million between\n2015\u201316 and 2019\u201320. the programme will continue offering grants of between $2,500 and $20,000 to community organisations and local governments for small capital projects that deliver social benefits for local communities. to support regional deals, the government is providing additional funding towards a $172.9\u00a0million hinkler regional deal, $45.4\u00a0million commitment to support the barkly regional deal and an initial $3.2\u00a0million to kick-start the albury-wodonga regional deal. these regional deals place a shared vision for communities at the centre of policy development by bringing together all levels of government, the private sector and other partners to improve the productivity and liveability of our regions while also responding to local needs and priorities. this government is delivering more jobs to our regions through our common-sense decentralisation agenda, further boosting local economies and placing services in the heart of the regions they serve. we have identified positions from an additional six agencies amounting to 191 jobs to be established or relocated, including from the department of infrastructure, regional development and cities; the australian financial security authority; comcare; and the department of prime minister and cabinet's indigenous affairs group and indigenous business australia. these initiatives will deliver local jobs to orange, darwin, launceston, alice springs, coffs harbour and hobart, among other locations, including the recently announced new offices for the murray-darling basin authority. this brings the total number of jobs relocated from canberra, central sydney and central melbourne to more than 1,700 since 2013. australian government funding for projects is typically provided on the basis of a contribution of up to 80 per cent of the total cost in regional areas and up to 50 per cent of the total cost in urban areas. the remainder is to be provided by state and territory governments, local governments and/or the private sector. key projects listed below do not

"], "5aa-breakfast-interview-david-penberthy-and-will-goodings-0": ["01 April 2019", "david penberthy: but for right now we turn our attention to the federal budget tomorrow and the announcement regarding the north-south corridor. the minister for cities alan tudge is on the line now. minister, good morning. alan tudge: good morning, thanks for having me on your program. will goodings: so minister, this money\u2019s been sort of promised, albeit in a smaller quantity before. this is signed, sealed, delivered this 1.5 billion? alan tudge: no, this hasn\u2019t been promised before. so last year we put $1.2 billion in towards the last section of the north-south corridor. tomorrow night in the budget, there will be a further $1.5 billion locked into the budget, so its $2.7 billion overall for the final section of the north-south corridor and that means\u2026 david penberthy: [talks over] so what will the budget line read, minister, will it read 1.5 or 2.7? alan tudge: so it\u2019ll read 1.5, but that\u2019s on top of the 1.2 that\u2019s already locked in from last year. so 2.7 all up, from the federal government to go towards the completion of the north-south corridor. david penberthy: so just on that point, sa labour in this state are saying that there was zero dollars in the last federal budget, 1.2 billion was announced but there was no budget line. alan tudge: well i mean they\u2019re wrong, i mean we announced 1.2 at last year\u2019s budget and now we\u2019re announcing a further 1.5 today so that\u2019s the all-up commitment. now we\u2019ve already committed $3 billion to the first few stages of the north-south corridor as you know. now this is the final stage, the last 10.5 kilometres which needs to be done. that planning work can begin and construction can start in 2022 and we\u2019re setting aside now in total $2.7 billion from the federal government, which the state will likely match so we\u2019ll have $5.4 billion to be able to complete the last section of the road to finally complete the north-south corridor, which will basically future proof adelaide for years to come. will goodings: so minister, in the past and this is before your time, but trying to get my prime ministers in order here, i think it was when tony abbott was prime minister and jamie briggs was the minister for infrastructure, the feds had tried to start a bit of a debate here in south australia about how we can best fund projects like this. and there were strong suggestions that we should look at it doing it \u2013 particularly if we\u2019re talking about tunnels here as part of the infrastructure \u2013 the feds view back then was that we should look at using tolls and that the provision of federal money should be contingent on south australia being prepared to consider that. is that still the view or is that still sort of- did that disappear with the former administration?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  lan tudge: no, that\u2019s not part of our plan. so this is grant money of a further $1.5 billion which will be in the budget papers tomorrow night. david penberthy: is there going to be a hit to gst for south australia in the budget tomorrow? alan tudge: will there be a hit to gst? david penberthy: yeah. alan tudge: i mean, everybody\u2019s been a winner out of the gst allocation, everybody\u2019s funding has been going up and of course we\u2019re putting more and more dollars into infrastructure as well into south australia as your population grows and to address some of those real urban congestion hotspots as well, such as smaller projects which we\u2019ve been announcing over the last few weeks. david penberthy: alan tudge, the minister for cities, thanks very much for your time this morning. alan tudge: yep, thanks very much dave. "], "press-conference": ["01 April 2019", "michael mccormack: it\u2019s great to be here with alan tudge, my colleague in the infrastructure portfolio and one of my many great colleagues with whom i\u2019ve worked so hard along with the prime minister scott morrison, along with the treasurer josh frydenberg to talk about infrastructure; more importantly, not just talk, but to get things done in the infrastructure space. tomorrow\u2019s budget is going to be an infrastructure budget. we are in the age of infrastructure, the age where we acknowledge that infrastructure is going to be so important to decongest our urban communities \u2013 certainly sydney, melbourne, and brisbane \u2013 to make sure that we bust through that congestion which is so prevalent in those capital cities. and we're also very focused on infrastructure for regional australia. that's why as the nationals leader, i\u2019m particularly delighted that there is an extra $1 billion \u2013 one thousand million dollars - for the roads of strategic importance. i know how critical that is to making sure that we get the right delivery for those feeder roads - not necessarily the national highways and byways, they're also being looked after in tomorrow night\u2019s budget - but certainly those feeder roads which are so, so integral in making sure that we get the right connectivity, that we get the right supply chain efficiency and we can boost productivity so we can get goods to port quicker and therefore to our markets. obviously we're very much focused on more free trade agreements \u2013 we signed that arrangement with indonesia just recently \u2013 to build on the free trade arrangements we\u2019ve made with south korea, with china and japan, as a liberals-nationals government. that\u2019s what we do - we get things done. and with a stronger economy, and that's what we have, we can put even more money into infrastructure, more money into making sure that we grow the economy because that's what we are all about. so we\u2019re busting through that urban congestion, making sure that we get the right connectivity in our regions and making sure that we address the population issues that we have in this nation. it\u2019s all about the age of infrastructure and that's what we're in. with those remarks, i'll hand over to alan and i\u2019m happy to take questions afterwards. alan tudge: well thanks, dpm. today we're announcing six urban congestion-busting projects, and this is on top of the $75 billion which we've already announced in terms of our infrastructure pipeline. and i'd just like to take you briefly through all six of those projects. we start in queensland; we have $500 million of additional money going towards the m1 upgrade. that is a motorway which is used by up to 155,000 cars every single day and is one of the most congested motorways in the country. this is an extra $500 million which we are putting towards this. and the particular work which will be undertaken with that money is from daisy hill through to the logan motorway. the next piece of infrastructure which we\u2019re announcing today is for new south wales. we're putting $200 million towards the third hawkesbury river crossing. again this is a bridge river crossing which has been cried out for by the local communities for years and years and years. up to 3000 cars per hour use that bridge in peak hour traffic and it's at capacity presently. so this piece of infrastructure will provide additional capacity there and make life so much easier for thousands of residents in that area who use that piece of piece of road every single day. in south australia, we're adding $1.5 billion to the north-south corridor. this is the major piece of infrastructure running all the way from the north to the south of adelaide. in last year\u2019s budget, we contributed $1.2 billion. this budget, we're putting in a further $1.5 billion, bringing us to a total of $2.7 billion for the final stage of the north-south corridor. the previous stages are already funded, well underway and will be completed soon. this will enable the final 10.5 kilometres to be done in adelaide, working closely with the marshall government. the planning work is already underway; construction will begin in 2022. that brings us to melbourne and geelong, where we have three major projects which we're announcing today. the first in geelong is the south geelong to waurn ponds railway line. now, this is a project which sarah henderson's been campaigning for since 2015. and in subsequent budgets we've been adding amounts of money to it. at this budget, we're adding a further $700 million to fully complete stages two and three of the waurn ponds to south geelong line. that means a full duplication of that line. presently, it is just a single line, it is at capacity and it needs to be duplicated to add capacity. it\u2019s a very fast growing area, it's a priority of the state government, and so this will get the job done. and of course for geelong, this is on top of the $2 billion which we announced just recently for the fast rail for geelong to melbourne to enable the 32-minute train journey into the cbd of melbourne. the second project is a massive suburban congestion-busting project for south east melbourne and for the northern suburbs of melbourne. some of those suburbs in the south east of melbourne and in the northern suburbs of melbourne are the fastest growing suburbs in australia. and this is $1.1 billion to go into particular roads in pakenham and cranbourne, in narre warren, in places like epping. and we\u2019ll be contributing 50 per cent of the funding for those, and the state government has already announced that it will be contributing 50 per cent. so this is another good partnership with the state government there as well. the final one is a $300 million package to seal 500 kilometres of unsealed roads in the dandenong ranges, which for those victorians \u2013 in fact, a lot of australians know the dandenong ranges - right at the foothills, just at the edge of the suburbs - will enable 500 kilometres of unsealed roads to be sealed. we'll be working closely with the local council to complete this project over a nine-year period.\u00a0 at the present rate the councils wouldn't be able to complete those 500 kilometres of roads for 80 years. we'll now be doing this in nine years and this will add safety, it adds convenience, and really it\u2019s going to enhance the tourism experience as well for the 600,000 tourists who go up into the dandenong ranges each and every year. it really is one of the iconic areas of victoria and of australia. so together, those six projects will really make a very significant difference to hundreds of thousands of people's lives. it'll bust congestion, it makes it easier for people to get to work and back home at night, safer and more quickly, and it's just another package of congestion-busting infrastructure which the liberal and national parties\u2019 government are able to announce. we were able to do so, as the dpm said, because we've got a strong economy. when you've got a strong economy, when your budget\u2019s back into the surplus, it means you've got money to invest in this congestion-busting infrastructure. question: one for mr tudge. over what period of time are we expecting the money to flow into these projects? alan tudge: all of that will be revealed in the budget tomorrow night, so i presume you\u2019ll be in the lock-up tomorrow and the details will be there. question: now one for victoria: infrastructure australia has not included the waurn ponds rail duplication on its priority list, saying the cost of the project outweighs the benefits. then why are we funding it? alan tudge: this is a priority of the state government\u2019s and we've been putting money towards this over the last few years. the state government at the election just last august said that this was a priority for them and they called for us to make a contribution to it. and so consequently we are making that contribution. that rail line is at capacity, and yet that area of geelong, that area of victoria, is growing exceptionally fast. geelong last year grew by 2.7 per cent; that\u2019s the same rate as melbourne which is the fastest growing big city in australia. so we need to build further capacity; this adds an additional railway line which means that you can put more trains on the rail. question: how big a role did sarah henderson play in getting the funding for [indistinct]? alan tudge: she has been advocating for this since 2015. i don't think there's been a single bigger advocate for this project than sarah henderson, but it's because we're in a strong financial position that we're able to put $700 million more to complete the final stages of this. if we didn\u2019t have a strong budget, we wouldn't be able to make such big contributions to infrastructure. that's been the work of the entire team. prime minister morrison, the deputy prime minister here, as well as the entire coalition team has enabled that hard work over many years to be done. question: why shouldn\u2019t this announcement, though, on the eve on an election be seen as a desperate attempt to secure corangamite? alan tudge: sarah has been campaigning on this since 2015. i think it was the 2016 budget that we put in $50 million. in last year\u2019s budget we\u2019ve put in a further $100 million towards this. and this year\u2019s budget we're putting in $700 million. so it's been a progression. and it was only at the last state election that the state government finally fully committed to doing the entire project. that was last august, and this is the first budget since their formal commitment where they called on us to back them in, and that's what we are doing: working with them, backing in their call for us to fund that project so it can be completed as soon as possible. it's already at capacity now. it needs to be done, and we want to get on with it as quickly as possible.

[end of excerpt] david bevan: okay. sounds to me, alan tudge, like he\u2019s going to start digging the hole and then, well, you're not going to leave it half completed. he\u2019s going to come back and ask for some more. alan tudge: well let's see what the business case actually says. it may be that the business case work comes back and says yes it can be completed within that envelope. if it requires a bit more money then let's look at that down the track. but this is serious dollars that we're putting on the table here. an additional one point five bringing up, as i said, our commitment for this final stage to $2.7 billion, and that of course is on top of the $3 billion which we've already put in to the construction at the earlier stages. david bevan: okay. now in a moment, we'll hear from raa. tom koutsantonis is a former transport minister, he\u2019s now shadow state transport minister, we\u2019ll hear from him.

"], "planning-australias-future-population": ["27 March 2019", "check against delivery last week, the prime minister, minister coleman and i announced our population plan. it is an integrated plan to ease the population pressure in our big capital cities while supporting the growth of those smaller cities and regions that want more people. it is a plan to accelerate infrastructure construction to deal with congestion now. and it is a plan to put in place the mechanisms to work more cooperatively with the states and territories to ensure that we can better deal with growth into the future. today, i would like to take you through these elements and some of the specific initiatives that underpin them. i will also address some of the questions that people have raised since the release of the population plan. let me start, though, by recapping how we got to this point. australia has been a fast growing country since federation. our current growth rate is about 1.6 per cent, which is around twice the pace of recent growth in the united states and almost three times the oecd average. this kind of rapid growth would present enough of a challenge for governments and town planners, even with all other factors remaining equal. but it is made even more challenging because the distribution of that growth has not been uniform. rather, melbourne, sydney and south east queensland have been growing exceptionally fast\u2014accounting for 75 per cent of our entire population growth\u2014while other parts of the country have minimal population growth and are often crying out for more people. melbourne grew by an incredible 2.7 per cent in 2016\u201317, with sydney and seq not far behind. only two other cities in the english speaking world added more people than melbourne during that year: atlanta and houston. sixty per cent of all our population growth has been driven by migration, but it is even higher in melbourne and sydney at 65 and 83 per cent respectively. but while we have had extraordinary growth in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland, there are other parts of australia that are growing more modestly. i have regional mayors come and see me almost weekly asking for assistance in finding workers for their communities. a place like dubbo, for example, has an unemployment rate of around 2.0 per cent . not long ago, the front page of the warnambool standard screamed \u201cwanted: 1,000 more workers!\u201d this is frequently not understood by people in the big cities. many think that there are no jobs in the smaller cities like adelaide or in the regions. in some places, that might be true, but in general, regional australia has been growing strongly and often can't get workers. i have heard from businesses in regional areas who are crying out for more people, where jobs are going unfilled and opportunities are being missed, because there are not enough workers with the right skills. analysis undertaken by the australian government department of infrastructure, regional development and cities shows that outside the big three cities\u2014sydney, melbourne and brisbane\u2014there are around 58,247 job vacancies. this is up 1.5 per cent from around 57,414 vacancies a year earlier, and 12.4 per cent from around 51,805 two years ago. this includes 40,608 job vacancies in the regions outside australia's mainland state capital cities. a report yet to be released by the regional australia institute shows this trend is evident across some very different parts of regional australia: far north queensland; geelong and the surf coast; and the riverina and murray. all three regions show an upward trend in vacancies since 2016. in geelong, job vacancy numbers are 15 per cent higher than three years ago, in far north queensland they are 34 per cent higher and in the riverina they are 57 per cent higher. job vacancies in regional areas have been growing at double the rate of metropolitan centres since 2016, across a range of skills and occupations. that is why it is so important that our population plan addresses the different challenges facing different parts of australia. managing our population growth well has also been challenging because of our federal structure. we at the federal level largely control the population growth rate\u2014through the migration settings\u2014while the states, territories and local councils have primary responsibility for delivering the infrastructure, housing approvals, schools, hospitals and other services. the levels of government have not always been aligned. in sydney, you actually had the two levels of governments working in opposite directions in the early to mid-2000s. you had premier bob carr who famously said that \u201csydney was full\u201d and was consequently not building the infrastructure for the future, while just a few years later, kevin rudd became pm and turbo-charged the population growth into sydney. the infrastructure couldn't keep up; the housing approvals couldn't keep up. in melbourne, the infrastructure simply hasn't kept pace with the growth. the outcome of fast population growth particularly into our big capitals and infrastructure and services not keeping up, is massive congestion. people have felt the slowdown of the traffic; they have felt the crush in the trains. and they are saying \u201cenough! give us a breather\u201d. the data backs up what residents know from experience. for example, a 30km melbourne inner freeway journey in peak morning traffic took 39 minutes on average ten years ago. now it takes an hour. this congestion doesn't just impact on livability, it also has an economic impact. the cost of congestion in our capital cities is estimated to rise to up to $40\u00a0billion by 2030 if there is no change. congestion and livability are key factors in considering our population growth settings, but we also need to take economic considerations into account. migration is a key driver of gdp growth for the country, not just in an absolute sense, but also in gdp per capita.\u00a0 that is, it has made us each wealthier.\u00a0 treasury estimates that about one fifth of our increase in wealth per person over the previous four decades is due to population factors.\u00a0 this is mainly through increasing the participation rate of our nation and boosting productivity. it increases the participation rate because we bring in migrants when they are young\u2014with a median age of 26 years old\u2014and because we focus on skilled migration.\u00a0 that is, they come here to work and help deal with the aging population.\u00a0 currently there are four working aged australians to every one person over the age of 65. without migration, this ratio would halve to just two-to-one by around 2066. it also boosts productivity of the nation because of the skills that we are able to bring in. which underscores the importance of getting migration settings just right, having described briefly the nature of some of the challenges, let me outline our proposed approach. there are many elements to our population plan, but they can be broadly categorised into four parts. the first part of our plan is to reduce the migration cap from 190,000 per annum to 160,000 and to maintain the lower figure for the next four years. right now, the vast majority of new migrants go presently to the big capitals and so reducing the migration rate is the first step to easing the pressure on melbourne and sydney particularly. then, within this 160,000 cap, we have allocated 23,000 places specifically for areas outside the large capital cities. on top of this, we have provided new incentives for international students to seek opportunities in smaller cities like adelaide or canberra or the regions. these measures work together to help ease the pressure in the big capitals while supporting stronger population growth elsewhere. there has been a lot of discussion about these new settings, in particular about how the 23,000 allocation will work. the answer is straightforward. it will work in the same way as the existing highly effective geographically-restricted visas work. it is not widely known that we already have conditional visas for new migrants to settle in areas outside the big cities, such as the 489 visa. we will use essentially the same methodology but with much larger numbers. under the 489 visa, for example, new migrants must live outside the big capitals for two years as a condition of that visa. they prove their place of residence in the normal ways: employment records, tenancy agreements, electricity bills etc. unsurprisingly, there is an exceptionally high compliance rate with that visa condition: 99.8 per cent. why is it unsurprising? because any breach of a visa condition puts one's long term residency prospects in australia in jeopardy. people don't take this risk because permanent residency in australia is a golden ticket that millions around the world seek. but do people then leave after two years and go to melbourne or sydney afterwards, defeating the purpose of the geographical condition of the visa? no they don't. in fact, over 85 per cent of people who settle in a regional area or smaller city are still there five years later. these geographically restricted visas work already and our new 23,000 allocation of places for areas outside of the capital cities will work in the same way. people will be asked to stay for three years as a condition of their visa before applying for full permanent residency. no one will be forced to take these dedicated places, but i suspect there will be thousands of people who will see those spots as a great opportunity to migrate to australia and make a home in adelaide or bendigo or any of the other great locations outside of the big four capitals. new incentives for international students are also geared to ease pressure in melbourne, sydney and brisbane. international students have been a large part of the population increase in recent years.\u00a0 on one method of counting, they have comprised 19 percent of the total population increase in the last decade.\u00a0 but like with other migrant categories, about 80 percent have gone to melbourne, sydney or brisbane.\u00a0 yet we know that other areas want international students and they are a great means of boosting local economies. we are introducing two incentives. the first is to provide an additional year's work rights for graduates of regional or smaller city universities. this will be an effective incentive because it will give many graduates the full three years of work rights that they need to then be able to apply for permanent residency. second, over 1,000 scholarships will be provided each year for students to study in a regional university. this will be available for both domestic and international students and are strongly supported by universities australia. these are significant changes to our migration settings and will have an impact. however, we have been careful in making these changes to ensure that they continue to support economic growth and family reunion. for example, while we are reducing the migration cap, we have actually increased the portion allocated for employer sponsored visas from 35,528 in 2017\u201318 to 39,000 places in 2019\u201320. we have also introduced a global talent scheme of 5,000 visas within the 160,000 cap. this is a specific category to fast track people into the country who are recognised as being outstanding in their field. we will be actively seeking out this global super talent to come to our country. we have also maintained the family reunion category. the main area where we have reduced the numbers is in the independent skilled migration stream, which has not been achieving strong employment outcomes. we have got the settings right to ease the pressure on our fast growing big capitals, support the growth of areas that are looking for workers, and also supporting the ongoing economic growth of the nation. the second part of our population plan is to build more congestion-busting infrastructure and fast rail to our regional cities to support decentralisation. put a different way, even as we are ease population pressure on the big cities by lowering the migration cap and encouraging more new migrants to the regions, we are massively increasing our infrastructure spend to address congestion. we are doing this in three ways. first, through big city and region-shaping infrastructure under our record $75\u00a0billion infrastructure plan. the government has invested in more than 600 major infrastructure projects since 2013. under the program, there are currently 162 projects in construction or development; 167 in the pre-construction stage; and 279 that have been completed. this includes major projects such as westconnex in sydney, the monash freeway upgrades, m80 upgrades and airport rail in melbourne and the gateway and ipswich motorways in brisbane. it also includes massive regional road and rail investment such as inland rail and the bruce highway. second, we're addressing local pinch points through the $1\u00a0billion in the urban congestion fund, which targets local bottlenecks. sometimes it takes as much time to get through a local congested intersection as it does to travel on the freeway. our approach is to fix those bottlenecks fast. third, by investment in fast rail, connecting the big capitals to the surrounding regional cities. our 20 year fast rail plan is a major new development. it is a practical plan to connect melbourne, sydney and brisbane respectively to their surrounding regional centres with the express purpose of supporting decentralisation and growth in regional centres. \u00a0 we are ambitious in what we would like to see achieved over twenty years, but we are taking a practical approach to making it happen. over twenty years, we would like to see multiple fast rail connections built from melbourne, sydney and brisbane respectively to surrounding regional centres. from melbourne, to centres such as geelong, bendigo, ballarat, shepparton, wodonga and traralgon. from sydney, to centres such as newcastle, wollongong, parkes and potentially all the way to canberra. and from brisbane, to centres such as the sunshine coast, gold coast and toowoomba. to make this happen, we are doing several things. we are investing $2\u00a0billion into getting the first project built: fast rail from melbourne to geelong. this would enable a journey of around half an hour. we hope the rail line can be under construction within a couple of years. this was chosen to be the first one built in part because the victorian government has also prioritised it with their $50m planning investment underway already. this route also complements our investment in melbourne airport rail. the melbourne airport rail link will go from the melbourne cbd to sunshine and then onto the melbourne airport, with the most expensive element being the infrastructure to increase capacity from the city to sunshine. the geelong fast rail would leverage this investment to sunshine. it would then involve the duplication of track from sunshine to wyndham vale and upgrading of track and signaling from wyndham vale to geelong. having made a serious investment to get the first project complete, we are also funding the business cases of other corridors, including sydney to wollongong, sydney to parkes, melbourne to albury-wodonga, melbourne to traralgon and brisbane to the gold coast. this will enable the government to determine future priorities. our investments here complement those being undertaken by state governments. we are establishing a new national faster rail agency, supported by an expert panel, which will lead the development and implementation of the faster rail plan. the agency will assess the outcomes of the faster rail business cases. people have talked about faster rail for a long time. we are making it happen with a practical plan and a specific purpose to support the population agenda. the third part of our plan is to work more closely with states and territories to manage population growth right across the country. state and local governments are in the best position to know how much growth their infrastructure and services can support, and where additional growth is needed. they need to have a greater say in the migration settings so their infrastructure and service plans align with population growth plans. last december, the prime minister led a discussion with states and territory leaders who have now all agreed to develop a national population and planning framework. the framework will provide greater certainty and transparency over population growth, including a better process for taking account of state and territory inputs to the migration program, improved population data sharing, and a focus on skills requirements at a regional level. we have also set money aside for a new centre for population which will take a leading role in the analysis to underpin the framework. the centre will help all levels of government and the community better understand how the populations of our states, cities and regions are changing and the challenges that change presents. we will also be negotiating more city and regional deals. these \u201cdeals\u201d are a new mechanism pioneered by our government which facilitate a long term plan across the three levels of government for a particular city or region. the strength of them is that they bring together all three levels of government, across multiple parties, and outline long term plans to support and manage growth. we have already signed city deals for townsville, launceston, western sydney, darwin, hobart, geelong and adelaide. we are also working with the queensland government and south east queensland mayors on a south east queensland city deal. this process marks a turning point in the way population is treated across government, with a move to greater collaboration, transparency and longer term planning. the final part of our plan is to keep australia together. australia is the most successful multicultural country on earth where we have welcomed people from around the world and in the process, we have been enriched. but we must continue to work to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the australian success story, is welcomed and included, and is encouraged to integrate. we have done this better than any other nation, but we are putting in an additional $71\u00a0million into new programs to further this effort. this includes: there is no better country than our great nation. we are free, prosperous, harmonious and have some of the most livable cities and regions in the world. but there is no room for complacency. over the last decade, our cities have been stretched to capacity and the infrastructure has not kept pace. meanwhile our regions are often crying out for more workers and more economic development. our population plan addresses these problems now and sets up a framework to plan better for the future. it immediately eases the population pressure on melbourne, sydney and south east queensland; it fixes the congestion hot spots while building the city shaping rail and freeways; and it sets up better planning arrangements with the states to guarantee our livability in years ahead.

"abc-ballarat-interview-nicole-chvastek": ["22 March 2019", "nicole chvastek: nicole chvastek, looking forward to your company through until 6 o'clock. well the prime minister and the minister for population and urban infrastructure have been in geelong today spruiking the commonwealth's proposed $2\u00a0billion in funding for a fast rail link to victoria's biggest regional city. the federal government has promised to deliver the funding if it's matched by the state government. but victoria's public transport minister jacinta allan says $2\u00a0billion is woefully inadequate. jacinta allan: we're always happy to talk to the federal government about funding victorian infrastructure but unfortunately this latest proposal on the eve of an election from the prime minister is woefully underfunded. it just proves again how little, the federal government knows or cares about victoria. nicole chvastek: that is jacinta allan who we will speak to in a few minutes but first alan tudge is the minister for population and urban infrastructure. alan tudge good afternoon. alan tudge: gday nicole and a proud victorian. nicole chvastek: that's great to hear. alan tudge, jacinta allan says that the money that you have promised is woefully inadequate and she has dismissed it as a thought bubble. alan tudge: we've been working on this for many, many months now. indeed one of the reasons which we've decided upon the fast rail link from geelong to melbourne as being the first cab off the rank is because the state government has been looking into this one as well. and they've put $50\u00a0million on the table to do the detailed viability assessments. now our estimates of the costs is about $4\u00a0billion and that's been estimated by our experts in the infrastructure department in canberra. nicole chvastek: well they say it'll cost $2\u00a0billion just to remove all of the level crossings and that this is, this is a program which is worth between $10 and $15\u00a0billion and $2\u00a0billion isn't going to cut it. alan tudge: so our estimates are that we'd be able to deliver fast rail which would enable a person to get from geelong to melbourne in 30 minutes for about $4\u00a0billion. now that being said- nicole chvastek: [interrupts] it's not going to happen though is it minister? i mean that's just pie in the sky. alan tudge: i completely disagree with you. people said that about the airport rail link as well, but we put $5\u00a0billion on the table in last year's budget. and it's from there- nicole chvastek: [interrupts] this is a $15\u00a0billion project and you're offering $2\u00a0billion. alan tudge: so as i said, the experts from the infrastructure department have estimated it would cost about $4\u00a0billion and we're putting $2\u00a0billion to get it going. and as the prime minister said today, if through the business case assessment process, which is occurring presently, if the costs come in a little bit higher than that then obviously we'd be open to looking into that question. but we need to get it going. and unless you've put serious dollars on the table people don't think that you're serious about getting the job done and that's what we're doing here with $2\u00a0billion on the table. nicole chvastek: but people- people don't- people don't think you're serious about getting the job done. these, these fast rail plans are always rolled out just prior to a federal election and they always come to nothing. and now this announcement that you've made today provides for a fraction of what is actually needed to build this thing. alan tudge: well i've been down in geelong today and there's certainly great excitement from people in geelong about the possibility of this. so i disagree with your assessment there. and we've done the work, the state government has got $50\u00a0million to do the detailed assessments, the design, the viability, the business case right now. and now we're putting $2\u00a0billion in the budget\u2014so it's money locked in, not a promise\u2014in the budget in order to get the project going. now we did that last year in terms of the airport rail, we put $5\u00a0billion in the budget and forced the hand of the state government to also come to the table and now we've got a rock solid commitment to get the airport rail done. now that should have been done decades ago but now we're getting started on it and equally it will be the same with the geelong fast rail. nicole chvastek: sure, well you'll be able to get rid of the level crossings with $2\u00a0billion, you just won't be able to build the actual rail link itself? alan tudge: well again i'm not sure why you make these assertions. the estimates which i have of $2- of $4\u00a0billion in total cost are from expert infrastructure people in our department in canberra who do these costings\u2026 nicole chvastek: [interrupts] my assertions come from the minister for public transport. alan tudge: \u2026who do these things on a regular basis. and they've suggested that to do the duplication of the section from sunshine to wyndham [vale] is going to cost about $2\u00a0billion and the upgrade of the rest of the line would also cost about $2\u00a0billion. but we find out of course the full costings by going through this business case process which the state government is funding presently. nicole chvastek: i'm speaking to alan tudge who is the minister for population and urban infrastructure. alan tudge isn't the reality that this is just a sop to the voters in corangamite? the reason that you're doing this on the eve of an election campaign is because this is an infrastructure project which will benefit the constituents in a seat that you are going to lose in eight weeks time. alan tudge: again i just don't accept your assertion there. and we've been working on this for six months and it's actually a core part of our population policy. and we've been outlining elements of our population policy this week and our\u2026 nicole chvastek: [interrupts] well where's the fast rail to sheppard to traralgon and to wodonga? alan tudge: and our- and if i can finish\u2014you put quite an aggressive assertion to me and so let me explain. so we've been working on population policy and we've been announcing significant policy this week, and the policy is designed to take some of the pressure off the big capital cities like melbourne and sydney whilst supporting the regional areas that want to grow faster or need more people. and indeed there are many areas such as warrnambool in victoria which is crying out for more workers; the businesses simply can't find people to do the jobs. and so the policies which we've been announcing first of all they encourage and incent [sic] more individuals to go to places like warrnambool. and then second when you put things like fast rail in place it enables people to live in a place like geelong and commute into melbourne should they choose to do so. so it also supports that overall agenda of decentralising from the city centre. nicole chvastek: so it's just a coincidence that it happens to be beneficial to the liberal party in its most marginal seat in australia? alan tudge: well i think that\u2026victoria in some respects is the most obvious state in terms of having a number of regional cities surrounding the big capital of melbourne, and in the medium to longer term we would like to see fast rail to each of those regional capitals. and by doing that you really support the growth, the economic prospects of those regional capitals as well as the population growth of those areas too. and the geelong route is the most advanced from the point of view of the state government, they've put money on the table in relation to that as i was saying before. and so it's a priority of theirs. and obviously we'd like to work closely with them, hand in glove, just as we are doing with airport rail in order to get this one built as quickly as possible. nicole chvastek: so it's just a coincidence that this will benefit sarah henderson and the seat of corangamite which is your most marginal? alan tudge: well nicole you've got to\u2026you've got to work with the state governments on these as well and as i said\u2026 nicole chvastek: [interrupts] but the state government said you didn't tell them about this until last night? alan tudge: \u2026and as i said, the single biggest project which we have going on in victoria at the moment is a $5\u00a0billion commitment to the airport rail. now that goes through labor heartland. so that's our single biggest commitment and we just announced the joint agreement on that with the premier just last week or the week before. so that was what we announced just a couple of weeks ago\u2014\u00a0the airport rail link. now this rail link, as i said, is amongst the top priorities for the state government. \u00a0i mean we know that because they've got $50\u00a0million committed to it and they don't put $50\u00a0million towards something that they're not serious about. and we have to be able to work cooperatively with them in order to be able to get this built. nicole chvastek: how is it working cooperatively with them when you didn't tell them about this announcement until last night? alan tudge: again, the prime minister has had discussions with the premier in relation to this previously. we know it's a priority of the state government for reasons which i've explained and now we're announcing our commitments today of $2\u00a0billion to really kick start this project. now it had the effect\u2014let me just finish\u2014in relation to the airport rail when we put significant dollars on the table it had the effect of getting the commitment to make it happen. right? and now we're going to get that airport rail finally. as i said, it should have happened decades ago. we are doing the same thing here\u2026 $2\u00a0billion on the table. nicole chvastek: [talks over] how are you- how are you \u00a0going, the geelong- \u00a0how are you going to make the geelong fast rail happen? will you be duplicating the tracks? how are you going to make this happen? because the minister jacinta allan say's if the federal government were fair dinkum about helping deliver fast rail to geelong they would immediately fund their share of the waurn ponds duplication project and get on board with plans to build new tracks from southern cross station to wyndham vale. what's the actual physical plan to building this rail link? alan tudge: so there are three elements to it. there is the section from southern cross station to sunshine and that is in essence being built as part of the airport rail link. now, then the next section is from sunshine to wyndham vale and that's what would require duplication of the tracks so that there's a dedicated line. and then from wyndham vale all the way through to geelong we use the existing track but you'd have to upgrade it to better signalling, you'd have to straighten out some of the track in places, potentially upgrade some of the stations. so the major money is already\u2026the money is already committed through the airport rail for that first section\u2014southern cross to sunshine. for the second section would cost, our estimates are $2\u00a0billion to do the duplications. and then there's the upgrading from wyndham vale to geelong which is a further $2\u00a0billion and that's how\u2026 nicole chvastek: [talks over] and would it stop at stations along the way? alan tudge: \u2026and that's how we get to the $4\u00a0billion figure plus of course the additional money which will be going towards the southern cross to sunshine route which is already paid for out of the melbourne airport rail link. \u00a0 nicole chvastek: would this service stop- would this service stop at stations along the way? alan tudge: it possibly would, i mean this will be determined through the business case process as well. i think this is\u2026 nicole chvastek: well how do you how can you get from melbourne to geelong if you're stopping at stations along the way in 32 minutes? alan tudge: well it means that you have to have the average speed of 160\u00a0kilometres per hour, that's an average. now the train goes\u2026 nicole chvastek: [interrupts] sarah henderson said this morning it would be an express service? alan tudge: again, if i could finish nicole. so the basic math is it needs to be 160\u00a0kilometres per hour on average in order to do it in 30 minutes. then in some places if you're going 200\u00a0kilometres per hour for a significant section it means you can stop, and then keep going again, and still do it on average at 160\u00a0kilometres per hour. so therefore it gets to it in 30 minutes. nicole chvastek: [talks over] minister you can't- you can't get to geelong in 30 minutes on a train which is stopping at stations along the way. alan tudge: with due respect nicole, it is 80\u00a0kilometres long\u2014the track from the city to geelong. if the average is 160\u00a0kilometres per hour you get there in 30 minutes. that's just the basic maths. now these trains can go faster than that. and so it may be that you have some stops along the way at key places like say sunshine and wyndham vale or tarneit, but there will likely also to be express trains as well. but again that, that detailed work is determined through the business case assessment which is currently underway. nicole chvastek: minister where's the fast rail to ballarat? there's no mention of ballarat in this plan. where's the fast rail to traralgon, to wodonga? where is the rest of the infrastructure for victoria which feels pretty much left behind when it comes to infrastructure spending australia wide? alan tudge: so there's a couple of points there. so you've asked me about other fast rail to some of those other regional centres around melbourne and we would certainly like to see those completed over the medium term. what we announced today was in fact not just the fact that this is the first cab off the rank in being built, the geelong to melbourne, but also a number of further business cases in other areas such as the fast rail to wodonga. such as fast\u2026 nicole chvastek: [talks over] how many? alan tudge: let me finish. nicole chvastek: sure. alan tudge: such as fast rail to traralgon. nicole chvastek: how many more business cases do you need to understand that we need fast rail links to these regional capitals? alan tudge: so in each\u2026 in every single case before you\u2026 before you are able to invest all of the money and know the exact cost you need to do the business case work. these aren't things\u2026 nicole chvastek: [talks over] but there have been reviews been done since the dawn of time. alan tudge: nicole, let\u2026 just let me finish. nicole, just let me finish at least one question without being interrupted. so in every single major project like this you have to do the detailed design work, the engineering work, the cost benefit analysis, et cetera. now that costs money and does take a bit of time before you know exactly what the financing model is going to be, how much public money would be required, and those types of questions answered. so that's the type of work that has to be done in every single major project. so we're getting that work done on the traralgon line and on wodonga line and that then informs that decision making into the future so that we first off get the construction going on melbourne to geelong, then we get the planning work done and those other lines so we can assess what makes sense to be built next, with the medium and longer term vision that we have to have these fast rail corridors to all of these regional centres around, around melbourne in order to be able to properly manage our population growth. and that goes hand in glove, as i was saying earlier, with the slowdown in the migration rates, with encouraging more people to go to some of the regions that are looking for more people and to fill the jobs which are available. nicole chvastek: on the outside, the optics are that this is another plan for a fast rail that, that is not going to get off the ground. there have been multiple plans for fast rail since the dawn of time. you've put up one to geelong, you've offered $2\u00a0billion, the state government says that's not going to cut it\u2014this is a $15\u00a0billion project. and you said that we're going to investigate the possibility once again of fast rail to other regionals. with respect minister that's the mantra that regional australia has been hearing for the last 20 years. alan tudge: and again you're making a lot of assertions in that before putting the question to me. this is real budgeted money to get the geelong fast rail going. just as it was last year when we put $5\u00a0billion of real budgeted money to get the airport rail link going. and we expect a similar outcome\u2014that is that we'll be able to work with state government to actually get it built. and then at the same time there's never been the detailed business case assessment down to traralgon, with all due respect. and this will do the detailed business case assessment of that line to assess where it can be in the priority list and how viable that is. we'll also do that to, to wodonga. in relation to ballarat, which you asking me about earlier, that work is also being undertaken by the state government presently in, in conjunction with examining the geelong route. so this work is being done. that we've got to get it going at least in one location and that's why we've put $2\u00a0billion on the table to get it going first from melbourne to geelong. nicole chvastek: why do you get it going weeks out- for eight weeks out from the federal election? this is, this is an imperative that regional victoria has needed for decades. alan tudge: we've, we've been investing in in many different rail lines across victoria since we came to governmen\u2026 we've had that government before us nicole chvastek: [talks over] i'm talking about fast rail. alan tudge: we've been developing this plan and we've announced it today. i mean last year nicole chvastek: [interrupts] on the eve of the federal election? alan tudge: and again, i know you've put this to me several times now nicole, but let me therefore repeat back to you. last year for example our single biggest commitments which we announced a year and a half before the election was $5\u00a0billion for the airport rail. so because we're in a stronger financial position in the budget now we're able to do more infrastructure projects. now you can't spend significant sums of money on infrastructure unless you've got a healthy budget position. and as you know and as your listeners know we're now back in surplus as of this year's budget, and the last time we had a budget surplus was when peter costello was delivering one. so it's taken a long time to do all the hard work to get back into a budget surplus, to continue to grow the economy which therefore means we've got the money to do some of these big city and nation shaping infrastructure projects\u2026 nicole chvastek: [talks over] but where in alan tudge: like the airport rail, like this geelong fast rail. nicole chvastek: but we're in- we're in far deeper debt than we were when you came into office minister. when, when joe hockey was telling us we had a budget emergency. alan tudge: well, and i can tell you this year we get back to surplus. we inherited a massive budget deficit from the labour party and\u2026 nicole chvastek: [interrupts] and you've doubled the debt? alan tudge: but, but nicole until you get back to surplus, by definition the debt levels continue to increase because the deficit obviously contributes to the debt level. that's why we've been so determined year on year to keep expenditure under control and to continue to grow the economy, so that this year, 11 years after the last budget surplus, we will be back in budget surplus. and we've had labor and the greens fight tooth and nail against us on many of the measures we have put through the parliament to try to make cost savings to get back into this position\u2014tooth and nail. but we have got there. the economy is still growing strongly which means we're in a much stronger financial position now. and when you are, when you are in a stronger financial position it means you can invest in these larger scale infrastructure projects like this one. you can put record amounts of money into hospitals and list far more drugs on the pbs, which we have been doing. we can invest more in defence which was at anaemic levels of expenditure before we came to office. so these are the types of things which a strong economy relies upon, and that's what we have been focused on, and that's where we are. nicole chvastek: minister thank you for giving me your time. alan tudge: thanks very much nicole. nicole chvastek: alan tudge is the minister for population and urban infrastructure. he is also the member for aston in victoria.

"], "sky-news-live-interview-tom-connell": ["22 March 2019", "tom connell: minister, let's talk about your portfolio. more announcements today from the $1\u00a0billion urban congestion fund. how are you deciding which projects get the go ahead? is there a cost benefit analysis comparison? alan tudge: in essence, we take information from a number of sources. our department does some modelling itself in terms of working out where congestion hotspots are. we have advocacy from the local members of parliament and other community leaders, and of course the states and territories were consulted in terms of what their priorities were as well. and so today, we announced $253\u00a0million worth of congestion-busting projects. eight projects, very precise locations where they're going, to really address some of the bugbears which face people on a daily basis. and this is what people in the suburbs understand acutely is that, yes you've got to fix the major infrastructure such as the freeways and the rail, but often it takes you just as long to get to that train station or onto the freeway as it does actually travelling on it because of a particular intersection. so we're fixing up those particular intersections very surgically to make that travel commute time shorter. tom connell: look, it seems to make sense and everyone that's lived in the suburbs in particular, they all know, you know, don't go near this road and this road at 4 o'clock. you won't get out of that. alan tudge: yeah, exactly. tom connell: where do you sit, though, on the theory of induced demand? the example being if you build more roads, you will get more cars on them. alan tudge: so we're not just investing in roads but we're massively investing in rail as well. and of course we've got a broader population plan which aims to take the pressure off those big cities and further develop the regional centres and the smaller cities. so all of these things actually work together. on the rail front in, say, my hometown of melbourne where i am presently, i mean, our single biggest commitment here in victoria is actually to the airport rail. it should have been built decades ago but we put $5\u00a0billion on the table to get it underway. we've also got rail commitments to connect australia's largest university campus finally to the rail network and also out to baxter as well down the frankston line. so serious commitments there, car parking as well at railway stations, as well as obviously you have to continue to invest in road infrastructure too. tom connell: you've got the announcement as well recently of fast rail between melbourne and geelong. at the announcement, you were saying it could start being built within 18 months. but do you know what the cost is actually going to be and therefore whether it is viable? alan tudge: yes, so our experts in the infrastructure department in canberra have estimated that the cost would be about $4\u00a0billion dollars. two billion would go towards duplicating the rail link between sunshine and wyndham vale, and a further $2\u00a0billion towards upgrading the rest of the line and additional traffic signalling in the rest. of course on top of that, we'll be leveraging the investment which is being made into the airport rail link, and that will go from the city centre to sunshine and then out to the airport. that rail link between the city centre and sunshine is actually quite expensive, but that's being covered by the investment in the airport rail. we then leverage that for the rest of the rail link out to geelong, and by the time it's finished, a person will be able to get in on the train in geelong and be at southern cross station in 30 minutes, 32 minutes, and therefore be able to do that commute daily. tom connell: because the vic government talks about this project being maybe $10\u00a0billion. if it's significantly more than $4\u00a0billion, does it make it viable and also worth the cost? because it's obviously a zero sum game when you're out there deciding what to tip money into? alan tudge: yeah so- and they haven't been clear in terms of outlining how they get to that figure of 10\u00a0billion. as i said the link between southern cross station and sunshine\u2014which is part of the airport rail link\u2014that link itself will cost $5 to $6\u00a0billion, that element of it. so if you add that \u2026 tom connell: but you count that's basically the difference of the two figures? alan tudge: yeah. correct. that's what i understand. as i said, the state government hasn't been clear but that's an expensive part of it because it'll involve tunnelling right into the cbd. tom connell: well, you better talk to them, to the state government then, to say where you get to $10\u00a0billion. if that price tag's a lot more than four, you might have to reconsider the project? alan tudge: well, we've already got the money set aside for melb- from southern cross to sunshine then out to the airport. $5\u00a0billion dollars from us, five billion from the state and there'll be some private investment as well, so it's a huge commitment. as i said, then in terms of the rest of the line out to geelong, our experts who do these types of costings regularly have estimated it would cost $4\u00a0billion, of which we're putting 2\u00a0billion on the table. now we know this is a priority for the states, they've said it themselves. they've actually got $50\u00a0million doing that detailed business case work. if it comes out a little bit more expensive, of course we'll be open to looking at that. we want to get this built, and want to get it started as soon as possible to make it easier for people to commute from geelong. tom connell: one project higher on the infrastructure australia priority list compared to melbourne-geelong\u2014which is on that list\u2014is the high speed rail link between brisbane and melbourne. it has a timeframe that's shorter as well of zero to five years. is the government actively considering at least reserving the corridor in the upcoming budget for that? alan tudge: well corridor reservation has to be done by state governments. what we've outlined in our fast rail plan is that we would like to see progressively over the next 20 years a number of the orbital regional centres surrounding the big three capitals of melbourne, sydney, and brisbane connected to fast rail. and we're doing that for a purpose and that is to support a decentralization agenda outside of those three big capitals, because our analysis shows that those three big capitals are getting 75 per cent of all of the population growth in this country and they're bursting at the seams at the moment. so this goes hand-in-glove, this fast rail plan of ours with our migration settings to help grow the other parts of the country faster and just ease the pressure slightly in melbourne, sydney and brisbane \u2026 tom connell: [talks over] and i do want to get to the migration settings in a moment, but just on that corridor, you say the states but the federal government can help with money and can step in and say hey this is something we want to build and that's why you should bother reserving the corridor. i mean, it would be crazy to reserve a corridor if a government didn't want to actually link the rail up there. are you seriously looking at whether or not you help fund that and coordinate the corridor as infrastructure australia says? alan tudge: so we've outlined our fast rail plan tom, as i've indicated just then, and it is fast rail for a purpose, and that is to support the decentralisation agenda. now if the state government wants to reserve that corridor as well, good luck to them but our agenda is out of brisbane, for example, to get on with doing the business cases for brisbane to the sunshine coast and brisbane to the gold coast, as well as out to toowoomba, because you can imagine you get those three fast rails done it will actually take that pressure off brisbane. same in here in melbourne but we're not \u2026 tom connell: [talks over] i can understand that, but if you want to get the fast rail done, even- you know, this is a future project. no one thinks this is going to be up and running in a few years but it will be a hell of a lot cheaper if the corridor was actually reserved. you're saying it's up to the states. you've got- you're not looking at that at all at the moment? alan tudge: well only the states can actually reserve the corridor. i mean they have responsibility for the crown land. tom connell: [talks over] but you can help with money. alan tudge: that would have to be their priority. we've outlined our plan as a- and it's as i said, it's got a particular objective in mind. we're starting with the first one with serious money on the table for geelong, and then we're progressively want to be able to do these fast rail corridors to other regional capitals surrounding the big cities. that is the important thing to do. it supports our population plan. tom connell: okay. you mentioned the population plan. now we've finally got this immigration number released last week, so have the figure of 160,000, a new cap, not the target. i got the message there. what's the government aiming for in terms of the population of australia in say 2030 or 2050? alan tudge: oh, we haven't set a number there and the key thing, tom, is that you need to have managed growth and that's what our plan is about because you can have a city of a million people which is heavily congested, but likewise you can have a city of, say, five million people which is planned well which actually- where the traffic moves quite well and remains very liveable. so the question is the how well you manage the growth, rather than necessarily the destination which you get to. and that's what our plan is about. it's recognising that we've got exceptionally fast growth in melbourne, sydney and brisbane and the infrastructure hasn't kept up. and so take the population pressures off those three, support the population growth elsewhere, then build the infrastructure rapidly including pinch points and fast rail, then further have a population planning mechanism with the states so you can better manage the growth into the future including migration settings at a much more local level. tom connell: do you not need, though, because a lot of infrastructure decisions have to happen a long time before, we need to basically know how the various cities are going to be built many years in advance. don't you then need a number you're working towards as well, as to how many people will be there using that infrastructure? alan tudge: i think you have to have a considered view, city by city and region by region, and that's where our population planning framework comes into place, which is being developed with the states and territories. and it's also where our centre for the population which we're creating will come into play as well. we need to be able to work with the states and territories on this because while we've got the major population growth lever being the migration rate, they've got the primary responsibility for the infrastructure and service delivery, the housing approvals and the like, and those things need to be completely aligned and they haven't always been. so almost part three of our plan is to develop this better population planning mechanisms with the states and territories. it means they get a greater say, for example, over the migration rate into their states and into their regions but also us being more closely at the table in terms of infrastructure development, so you'll get exactly what you're talking about, tom. you can get the infrastructure built, ideally ahead of the population growth. you get the housing approvals in pace with the population growth, rather than \u2026 tom connell: [talks over] and i get that, but if you're getting the sort of a plan for infrastructure and housing and you're putting specific plans out there, you'd need a number wouldn't you? i mean, is there a reluctance to put a number on our population for any reason? alan tudge: as i said, the question is how you manage the growth in every part of australia rather than necessarily what australia might be in 10, 20, or 30 years' time and the settings will be adjusted over the years as well. and i think we're now putting in place the pieces to manage our growth in a much better way, so that we don't end up with the situation where we've got very rapid growth without the infrastructure keeping pace in big capital cities, or likewise where we end up with the situation where you've got jobs that can't be filled by people in parts of regional australia which we presently have. so that's what our plan is about. tom connell: minister alan tudge, now unofficially known as the congestion buster, we'll see how your job goes. thank you. alan tudge: thanks very much tom.

"], "investing-victorias-future": ["28 February 2019", "thank you dr tony morton, [president, public transport users association] for the introduction. good morning ladies and gentlemen. it is a pleasure to join you for day two of the victoria transport infrastructure summit. the theme of this summit is of great interest to me, both in my role as federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population but also as a lifelong melburnian. melbourne's growth has for many years now been the focus of public debate, especially with regard to its impact on city planning and functionality. and while quality transport infrastructure has long been critical and in many cases, a defining, characteristic of city functionality and success, the importance of delivering the right infrastructure in a timely manner has become more complex\u2014especially in the context of rapid population growth. this is something that the coalition government understands. it is why the prime minister created a new portfolio which merged population policy with urban infrastructure and cities policy. all of you in this room will understand the interconnectedness of these three policy areas. population growth, for example, is the major reason for building more infrastructure, while our big capitals\u2014like here in melbourne\u2014are where most of the growth is occurring. getting alignment across these three policy areas is fundamental to creating better cities\u2014and given that our major cities are where the majority of australians live, it will significantly help drive our economic performance and improve quality of life. as you know, our cities are changing rapidly. i am a melbourne boy\u2014born and bred\u2014growing up on the very outskirts of the city in pakenham. when i was growing up, pakenham had just a few thousand people and was more or less a country town. in fact, the hospital in which i was born was called the pakenham bush nursing hospital. today, that suburb is home to 46,000 people and there are houses from here to pakenham and beyond, 55\u00a0kilometres out. that's how much melbourne has changed in my lifetime. australia has a history of strong population growth, growing faster than most other advanced economies. our population grew by around four million people in the last 10 years, far greater than in the previous decade. we have benefitted from that growth. a larger and more diverse population has supported a growing economy. however, population growth has not been even across the country. rather, 75 percent of the population growth has been to just three areas\u2014melbourne, sydney, and south east queensland. with melbourne growing the fastest. last year it grew by 2.7 percent or about 130,000 people. this makes it one of the fastest growing cities in the developed world. moreover, the growth has been well above expectations. in 2004, melbourne was forecast to grow by 500,000 people by now. it grew by 1.2\u00a0million. this has put enormous strain our city, and frankly, the infrastructure simply hasn't kept up. ten years ago, you could have 90 percent confidence of completing a 30km freeway journey in melbourne peak hour in 39 minutes. today, that figure is 59 minutes. avoidable congestion in australia's cities cost $25\u00a0billion a year in 2017\u201318. this is predicted to rise to as much as $37\u00a0billion per year by 2030. i remember we used to laud our traffic over sydneysiders\u2014that's no longer the case. all big cities have some congestion and people understand this, but much of the congestion in our big cities has come about from avoidable factors. in particular the lack of infrastructure to cater for the very fast population growth; and the lack of coordination between the federal government (that controls the major population growth lever, migration) and the state government which is primarily responsible for building the roads and rail as well as providing service delivery. so what is our government's plan? first, we are investing record amounts in the major, city shaping roads and rail corridors. as soon as we came to office we lifted investment in every state and territory, and in the last budget we allocated a record $75\u00a0billion to infrastructure, through a forward 10-year plan. we have lifted annual expenditure by more than a billion on average, since coming to office. the victorian government is good at repeating a line that victoria is missing out on infrastructure dollars. but this is simply not the case. over the next decade, victoria has been allocated 30 percent of the federal funds. many of the projects we are funding are ones that have been on the books for decades, but never got off the ground. we are now providing the funds to build them. this includes $5\u00a0billion to finally get a rail link to melbourne airport. a rail connection linking the cbd and melbourne airport has been talked about for 50 years\u2014the coalition government has made this a reality. sydney and brisbane already have such a rail connection, with construction well underway in perth. over 35\u00a0million people used melbourne airport in 2016\u201317, making it the nation's second busiest airport, with forecasts indicating a throughput of 68\u00a0million passengers per year by 2037\u201338. this will be a city-shaping project, a transformative piece of infrastructure that will alleviate congestion on the tullamarine freeway, which is used by up to 210,000 vehicles every day. this was not on the state government's agenda and they still haven't budgeted any funds for it (although they had an election commitment to match our $5\u00a0billion). we want to see this project moving fast. the projects also include $475\u00a0million to finally connect australia's largest university campus\u2014monash clayton\u2014to the rail network. we have also put $1.75\u00a0billion towards the north east link. this means, according to premier andrews, that the project is now \u201cfully funded\u201d and can get going fast. this road will finally create a ring road for melbourne. other projects funded in last year's budget alone include: these commitments come on top of many other projects funded by the commonwealth that are currently under delivery, like the monash freeway upgrades, the m80 ring road upgrades and the recently completed tullamarine freeway upgrade. i also want to mention a road that simply has to be built and we are not giving up on it: the east west link. this is a road which in the recently released priorities list from infrastructure australia remains one of only a handful of projects in the top priority category. eighty thousand cars get stuck on the eastern freeway each day. it is ridiculous that one of our biggest freeway in australia comes to a full-stop at hoddle street and does not flow through to freeways in the west. it has to be built which even bill shorten acknowledged in 2008, when the city had a million fewer people. \u201cdoing nothing\u2026will threaten melbourne's future economic success and livability\u201d, he said. whenever a state government is willing to build the road, we will provide $3\u00a0billion. in total, the coalition government has committed over $20\u00a0billion towards transport infrastructure in victoria since coming to government\u2014and we are always looking to do more. delivering major national or city-shaping projects is a central part of our infrastructure agenda, but we also understand that it is not the only response. for many people, it is often local congestion issues which cause the greatest frustration. that's why a second part of our plan is fixing local congestion hot-spots. these projects typically require less capital expenditure but often have tremendous benefit-cost-ratios. over the last few weeks, the prime minister and i have announced $505\u00a0million from a $1\u00a0billion urban congestion fund, for these small scale projects. it includes projects like fixing the eight intersections along the princess highway between pakenham and berwick. this funding recognises the fact that a large part of a person's commute can be getting onto the highway or freeway at a key intersection, as much as it is the travel time on the major road itself. our aim is to get people to their destination and back faster and safer and so we need to be allocating funds to both the major corridors and the local pinch points that cause considerable time delays. for example, in mitcham and ringwood, one of the biggest issues is lack of car parking at the railway stations. we want to encourage people to get off the roads and onto the trains, but if there is no parking, how can they? this is why as part of the urban congestion fund we announced commitments to six commuter car parks across melbourne, with an estimated 2000 spaces to be built. this means 2000 cars off the road and more people on public transport. many of these congestion busting projects in melbourne are in the fast growing south eastern or northern corridors. we know there are dozens more that could be funded. longer term, we have to be better at having the infrastructure built before the population outgrows it. this is where our population policy comes into play. as i mentioned earlier, under our federation, the federal government controls the major population growth lever (being the migration rate) while the states have primary responsibility for building the infrastructure, the services and things like housing approvals to cater for the growth. sometimes these are not aligned. our population policy will marry these two things more closely. as part of this, the prime minister has asked the states and territories to have a far greater role in our migration settings\u2014to achieve a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 view rather than just a \u2018top down\u2019 view on what our migration settings should be. we know that the big capitals are struggling with the very rapid population growth, while smaller states and some regions want to grow faster. we live in a great state and have as our capital one of the world's most liveable cities. but, liveability is much more than an index and a nice label. liveability in melbourne, and indeed all our cities, is intrinsically linked to australia's future prosperity and how we plan and cater for our growth. australia's major cities\u2014melbourne, sydney and brisbane\u2014are in the midst of a significant transformation brought about by rapid population growth. our government is continuing to invest to cater for this growth and developing policy to better coordinate state and federal efforts. but unless we have a strong economy, you cannot invest in major infrastructure upgrades. thank you for having me here today. "], "cities-congestion-and-opportunity-automated-vehicles": ["25 February 2019", "welcome to the australia-new zealand cities symposium, here in western sydney\u2014one of the fastest growing areas in

all for participating, and particularly acknowledge my co-host, the honourable phil twyford mp, minister for housing and urban development and minister for transport as well as her excellency the honourable dame annette king, high commissioner for new zealand and mr bill dobbie, consul-general for new zealand; today, the five sessions provide an opportunity to drill into the detail of effective partnerships, the challenges of population growth and advances in technology. as well as the innovative financing, and city-shaping potential, of urban infrastructure. australia is different to new zealand in that we have three levels of government, all with an interest in cities policy.\u00a0 this makes it particularly challenging for us, but our \u201ccity deal\u201d concept which our government pioneered a few years ago, is proving to be a really effective mechanism to align the priorities, planning and interests of the three levels of government. just yesterday, prime minster morrison and i announced the hobart city deal, being the 5th deal that we have now signed.\u00a0 in the previous week, we announced our intent to conduct a south east queensland city deal, covering 3.5\u00a0million people across the fast growing south east regions of queensland. the largest, most complex and most comprehensive deal, however, is the western sydney city deal.\u00a0 we will be discussing this in the first session today.\u00a0 built around our government's $5.3\u00a0billion commitment to the building a new western sydney airport, this city deal is a 20 year plan from the federal government, state government and eight local councils to cater for a further 500,000 people, generate 200,000 jobs, 200,000 new houses, and connecting infrastructure. in my opening comments today, however, i want to focus on perhaps the greatest challenge that our larger cities face\u2014congestion\u2014and how we are addressing it. city deals are a part of it, but there are other elements. i have a long ministerial title, but the prime minister refers to me as the \u201cminister for congestion busting\u201d which gives you an indication of the priority we are placing on it. i want to take you through the infrastructure plans and population policy we are developing, but focus my comments on the opportunity that automated vehicles could play in addressing the congestion challenge.\u00a0 the opportunities are immense, but we need to get the preparation right. australians in our biggest cities are spending more time stuck in traffic than ever before, particularly in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland\u2014the areas which have accounted for three quarters of australia's total population growth over the last five years. and as we all know, more time in the car means less time at home with our families, and less time to spend productively at work. looking at my home town of melbourne, ten years ago, a person could (with 90 percent confidence) complete their 30\u00a0kilometre morning freeway journey in 21 minutes. today, it takes 27 minutes. here in sydney, average morning peak hour journeys in sydney now take 65 per cent longer than off peak. by 2030, avoidable congestion is estimated to cost up to $37.3\u00a0billion, up from $16.5\u00a0billion in 2015. all big cities have some congestion and people understand this, but much of the congestion in our big cities has come about from avoidable factors.\u00a0 in particular the lack of infrastructure to cater for the very fast population growth;\u00a0 and the lack of coordination between the federal government (that controls the major population growth lever, migration) and the state government which is primarily responsible for building the roads and rail and service delivery. we saw these factors at work acutely in sydney when premier carr said that sydney was \u201cfull\u201d and consequently didn't build for a higher population growth, and yet a few years later, prime minster rudd turbocharged the migration rate, with much of the new arrivals going to sydney!\u00a0 the massive infrastructure build occurring now in sydney (supported by our government) is now just catching up on that period. so what is our government's plan for busting congestion?\u00a0 there are several parts. first, we are investing record amounts in the major, city shaping roads and rail corridors. this is part of a $75\u00a0billion infrastructure plan, which includes major projects in every capital city. many of these projects are ones that have been on the books for decades, but have never got off the ground.\u00a0 we are now building them. this includes $5\u00a0billion to finally get a rail link to melbourne airport\u2014australia's second busiest.\u00a0 it also includes $475m to finally connect australia's largest university campus\u2014monash clayton\u2014to the rail network. the second part of our plan is fixing local congestion hot-spots with smaller amounts of money. over the last few weeks, the prime minister and i have announced $505\u00a0million from a $1\u00a0billion urban congestion fund, for these small scale projects.\u00a0 it includes projects like fixing the 8 intersections along the princess highway between pakenham and berwick.\u00a0 this funding recognises the fact that a large part of a person's commute can be getting onto the highway or freeway at a

major corridors and the local pinch points that cause considerable time delays. the third part of the congestion-busting plan is have more effective population policy, that will ease the pressure off the big cities, support the growth of the smaller cities and regions, and also better marry population growth with infrastructure and service delivery. as part of this, the prime minister has asked the states and territories to have a far greater role in our migration settings\u2014to achieve a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 view rather than just a \u2018top down\u2019 view on what our migration policy should be.\u00a0 we know that the big capitals are struggling with the very rapid population growth, while smaller states and some regions want to grow faster. our cities policy can be a part of this\u2014supporting governance arrangements so that population growth and infrastructure are aligned at a localised level. but we also need a national framework. these three elements of our plan are all underway. but we are also thinking about the future and how technology could assist in addressing congestion and getting people across our cities more rapidly. australia is already a leader in using technology to make our roads more effective, through things like managed motorways.\u00a0 but the biggest opportunity will come with the development and wider-spread usage of automated vehicles. depending on the uptake, automated vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce congestion on our roads within a decade.\u00a0 new modelling from the bureau of infrastructure, transport and regional economics indicates that by 2030, congestion costs would drop by more than a quarter if automated vehicles account for 30 per cent of kilometers travelled (a \u201cfast penetration scenario\u201d). they estimate it would drop from $37\u00a0billion of avoidable congestion to $27\u00a0billion. this is an incredible figure. it is the equivalent to the outcome you would get from tens of billions of dollars of added road and rail capacity. how would automated vehicles reduce congestion?\u00a0 and is such uptake of automated vehicles likely? the answer to the first question is easier than the answer to the second. there are several ways that automated vehicles can reduce congestion, but the main one is that it would allow cars to safely travel more closely together.\u00a0 consider a freeway at the moment before it has so many vehicles that the traffic slows below the regulated speed. that is, the moment before it begins to experience congestion.\u00a0 if you took an aerial photo at that moment, you would see that the vehicles occupy only 8 percent of the freeway bitumen. ninety two percent of the freeway is not occupied, but is necessary for driver safety. if the vehicles were automated, then they could travel far more closely together. if they occupied, for example, 16 percent of the space, rather than 8 percent, you are effectively doubling the freeway capacity. this data is from zoox, one of the global leaders in automated vehicles, based in silicon valley.\u00a0 i visited them earlier this year and they informed me of these figures based on us analysis.\u00a0 however, the situation is likely to be the same here in australia. automated vehicles may also mean that space for car parking is less necessary. and the time taken for car parking significantly reduced.\u00a0 figures, again from zoox, estimate that up to a third of all inner city footprint is carparks.\u00a0 a huge amount of traffic is generated from simply searching for parking spots. further, with automated vehicles, ride share could become more affordable, reliable and hence more common, taking other vehicles off the road.\u00a0 that is, mass, customised shared transport is possible. combining artificial intelligence with connectivity would also allow active management of transport networks in real-time through predictive modelling, enabling congestion to be addressed before it happens. the potential congestion alleviating benefits seem clear, but is the uptake of automated vehicles likely to happen? it certainly won't be happening on a mass scale tomorrow or next year, but in a decade's time, automated vehicles will almost certainly be a significant feature of large cities around the world. this is the view of many experts in the field. consider what is occurring already. most major vehicle manufacturers are developing vehicles with higher levels of automation, including vehicles that are designed to require no human control. sophisticated automated driving features\u2014such as lane-keep and traffic jam assist\u2014are already available in current model vehicles. moderately sophisticated automated vehicles are currently being deployed in some countries.\u00a0 for example, google's waymo began trialing a commercial automated taxi service in phoenix, arizona late last year. zoox is launching their shared ride vehicles (essentially uber without drivers) next year, at a yet undisclosed city. they have already tested it extensively in san francisco, one of the more complex cities to drive. even here in australia, we have trials occurring and already taking people.\u00a0 for example, the royal automobile club of wa has developed its \u2018intellibus\u2019 trial involving a fully driverless electric shuttle bus in perth, supported by a grant from our government through our smart cities and suburbs program. the trial involves testing the shuttle bus in a variety of settings and scenarios, with various degrees of interaction with road users. the trial, now in its final stage, has already carried 11,000 passengers along the 3.5\u00a0kilometre route on public roads. i have focussed on the benefits of alleviating congestion, but the safety benefits could also be significant given that over 90 percent of all accidents on the roads today relate to driver error. so how do we realise the benefits of automated vehicles? many companies around the world the world are rapidly advancing the technology as i have outlined.\u00a0 the challenge for governments is the regulatory environment and ensuring that we are prepared to capture the opportunities that automated vehicles will present in the future. there are significant issues that we need to be considering now. for example, marking roads with brighter lines or considering whether newly resurfaced roads from now should have nanoparticles placed in the bitumen. our government has already taken several steps and is working closely with state and territory governments, the national transport commission and austroads as well as through the transport and infrastructure council to support the safe and early deployment of automated vehicles in australia. this work is supported by our government's announcement in october 2018 of almost $10\u00a0million to advance work to prepare australia for automated vehicles and other transport innovations, including through establishing the office of future transport technology within the infrastructure department while much of the implementation will be at the state level, it is important that there is national consistency in policy or else we will have new \u201crail gauge\u201d problem where an av car from victoria may be unable to \u201cread\u201d the road or be authorised to drive on it in new south wales. the office of future technologies has been tasked to collaborate across governments to ensure automated vehicles are safe, to consider future infrastructure needs, to make sure cyber security safeguards are in place, and to support australian businesses in taking advantage of new commercial opportunities. the office will play a leading role in the national coordination of new transport technologies and ensure that there is a supportive regulatory framework and policies, consistent with international best practice. the deputy prime minister and i are both taking a strong interest in the outcomes of this work and have requested that they explore how our future infrastructure requirements will be shaped by their introduction\u2014looking at the development of \u2018smart\u2019 roads, with sensors in the asphalt, for example. in addition, the house of representatives committee on infrastructure, transport and cities\u2014chaired by my colleague john alexander mp\u2014has launched an inquiry into automated mass transit, which is considering a range of issues relating to avs. i look forward to receiving their report in the coming months.\u00a0 we know already from the international research that there are a range of issues to consider when looking at avs, and a range of possible outcomes following their implementation into a transport network. \u00a0we need to optimise it for our context. i have only touched on a few issues that you will be discussing today. our two countries are used to working together, but today's symposium\u2014an initiative of our two governments\u2014is particularly welcome. i would like to thank minister twyford for coming and for facilitating the attendance of such a high-level delegation from new zealand. thank you for your time and i hope you enjoy the symposium.

"], "city-deal-tackle-congestion-across-hobart": ["22 February 2019", "the hobart city deal is a 10-year vision for greater hobart that will create the right conditions to secure hobart's long-term future as a productive and liveable city. the $730\u00a0million congestion busting package\u2014unveiled today as a key plank of the city deal\u2014will mean families spending more time together and the people of hobart getting home sooner and safer. driving this commitment will be $486\u00a0million from the morrison government and $221\u00a0million from the tasmanian government to bolster a range of transport infrastructure projects. in addition, the greater hobart councils will be contributing $23\u00a0million to the \u201cgreater hobart transport vision\u201d as part of the overall package. federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population alan tudge said this element of the deal would secure a reliable, sustainable and cost-effective transport system. \u201chobart suffers congestion at times, just like other cities. hobart is also growing and we want to eliminate those local, frustrating pinch-points but also future-proof the wider network for the next generations,\u201d he said. \u201cthis is all about reducing congestion so the community can spend more time with family and friends and less time in the car, providing significant civil construction jobs and making it easier for tasmania's world-famous industries to get their goods to market.\u201d at the centre of this raft of infrastructure investment is $461\u00a0million from the morrison government and $115\u00a0million from the hodgman government to jointly fund the bridgewater bridge replacement\u2014the largest transport infrastructure project in hobart's history. other investments will include a fifth lane for the southern outlet, a south east traffic package, progressing a hobart transit centre, establishing a derwent ferry service, modernising and integration of the public transport system, and considering ways to improve transport flows around and through the cbd including macquarie and davey streets. the morrison government is also committing an additional $25\u00a0million to ease congestion and improve access in and around the city's northern suburbs by activating the northern suburbs transit corridor. attorney-general and liberal member for clark, elise archer identified the northern suburbs transit corridor growth strategy as potentially a game-changer for the city. \u201cthe northern suburbs transit corridor is a priority area for urban renewal under the city deal,\u201d ms archer said. \u201ca greater diversity of housing solutions will be encouraged along the corridor and this will support the future delivery of the most effective public transport solution, while also reducing congestion.\u201d the morrison government's $25\u00a0million commitment to the corridor is part of its $1\u00a0billion nationwide urban congestion fund, which is tackling the economic and social cost of congestion in major cities by fixing congestion hot spots. \u201cbuilding on the work undertaken to date, the tasmanian government and the hobart and glenorchy councils will develop a strategy for urban renewal and activation of the northern suburbs transit corridor along the existing rail corridor,\u201d ms archer said. the hodgman government has also allocated an additional $20\u00a0million towards the better utilisation of transport infrastructure to help address congestion affecting the kingborough municipal area. to complement this new commitment to the region, a further $800,000 will be spent redeveloping the kingston bus interchange and providing a higher volume of services. hobart's transformative city deal commits all levels of government to work together to deliver a transport vision to keep the tasmanian capital and surrounding areas moving for decades to come. "], "doorstop-geelong-vic": ["22 February 2019", "the hon sarah henderson mp, assistant minister for social services, housing and disability services: well good morning everyone. this is an incredible day for geelong for corangamite and for the entire south west of victoria. it's wonderful to have the prime minister here, of course josh frydenberg, dan tehan, alan tudge, all together announcing this incredible investment for fast rail, something that i've advocated for a very long time. prime minister, i am absolutely thrilled, this is game-changing investment. what this demonstrates is that we're getting on with business, getting things done. i'd now like to welcome the prime minister to make the formal announcement. prime minister: well thanks very much sarah and congratulations to you. you've been a champion for your community every single day, for important infrastructure projects all over this wonderful part of australia. today we're announcing $2 billion dollars for faster rail to connect geelong to melbourne. now this project is part of a broader population plan that i announced this week together with alan tudge, to ensure that we're planning for australia's future population growth. these are the big challenges we're facing as a country. what comes with growth is the need to plan for growth and to build for that growth. that is what we're doing right here with this project. part of our population plan is not only to get the migration settings right, not only getting the planning right working with state and local governments and not only investing in social cohesion projects that build the social fabric of our society to make sure that as we grow we grow together and we don't grow apart; the key to all of this is ensuring we have the infrastructure projects, which as sarah said, are game-changing. they make choices available to australians that they currently don't have. the opportunity for a half hour rail trip between geelong and melbourne will change not only did not geelong and corangamite, but it will also change melbourne. because it will provide the opportunity for satellite cities to take the pressure off those who are living in melbourne and at the same time open up new opportunities for those who are living in these rapidly-growing parts of south eastern victoria and southern victoria. so this is part of a bigger plan today, as alan will talk more about. we're also putting in place a series of further business cases into other fast rail projects, to demonstrate that this is part of a broader initiative. this isn't just one rail project in one part of victoria. this is part of a plan to manage our population growth into the future. now we have a plan for doing that. we have a plan that embraces all the things you need to do to get on top of the pressures that australians are feeling in our big cities. i want australians to get home on time and safely, to spend time with their families. i want tradies to be able to get on site on time and be able to earn on site, because they don't get stuck in traffic jams. i want those who live in places like geelong to be able to have a reasonable commute, to ensure that they can get home on time and they can get to work without having to get up well before dawn. so this is going to make real choices available to people here in geelong and corangamite. it's going to make real choices for people available on the gold coast, real choice available to those living south of sydney in wollongong. we already have also projects underway and being assessed as business cases, up to newcastle. this is how we manage the growth of our cities into the future and that's how we can seize the opportunities for australians all around the country. the hon josh frydenberg mp, treasurer: well thanks, pm, thanks for your leadership in supporting this visionary project. it's great to be here with sarah henderson, nobody works harder in the parliament for her local community than sarah. so congratulations to you and alan, you've shown enormous hard work, dedication and vision for the work that we're now seeing in this congestion-busting infrastructure. and dan tehan who is a great local advocate for his community, but also for state-wide and nationwide infrastructure. well, as a proud and passionate victorian, i'm particularly pleased to see the federal government invest in this important victorian infrastructure project. it will create jobs. it will bust congestion and it will unlock the potential of our regions. as the prime minister said, it can only be done with a strong economy. its one of many projects we have throughout the country, with our $75 billion infrastructure plan.\u00a0 that is only possible through a strong economy.\u00a0 so thank you prime minister, thank you colleagues. this is a great victorian project and this will be great for the workers, their families and the businesses of victoria. the hon alan tudge mp, minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: thanks pm and colleagues. this project will change melbourne and geelong forever. i'd like to take you through just some of the specifics in relation to this $2 billion investment and how it fits in with the broader fast rail plan. the $2 billion investments will allow the construction of fast rail from melbourne to geelong, which presently takes about 60 minutes. but it's a heavily congested rail route and particularly through wyndham, tarneit and through to sunshine. once completed it will enable a 30 minute journey. so that means if you're going to the footy, like tonight for the big game, you could get there in half an hour rather than battling the traffic on the freeway. now most of the money would be spent duplicating the rail from sunshine through to wyndham vale, a dedicated line for this. then it would connect up to the existing line, but a further couple of billion would be required in order to upgrade that, for better signalling, better railway stations and other things. so we estimate it will cost in the vicinity of $4 billion dollars all up, that\u2019s the expert estimate from our federal department. as the prime minister said, this is the first cab off the rank for fast rail. over the next couple of decades, we have to have fast rail which connects up from our orbital cities to our large capitals of melbourne, sydney and brisbane particularly. this is part of our population plan, because when you connect up those orbital cities with fast rail, it means you take the pressure off the big cities and enable further growth in those orbital cities surrounding those big capitals. that's exactly what our medium and longer term plan is designed to do. now to achieve that, we're putting in place the architecture right now. that includes setting up a fast rail agency which will be able to provide ongoing advice and assessments. we're also investigating and putting $40 million into five additional business cases for five additional corridors. now that includes two additional ones right here in victoria, down to traralgon and also up to wodonga. those business cases will take approximately 18 months to complete and following the completion of the business cases, we are then in a position to be able to determine what our next priorities should be. so it's not just this project, but it's a comprehensive fast rail plan which of course it sits as part of our broader population plan. i just conclude by also thanking you sarah for her advocacy, particularly of this particular rail link. she has been advocating for this for as long as i can remember sarah. it is a great day for geelong for the people here, but it's also a great day for melburnians as well, because projects like this work in concert with how other migration settings and other settings to take that pressure off melbourne, to enable the growth of the regional cities such as geelong. in doing so, you help melbourne, you help geelong and you help australia. prime minister: okay happy to take questions, but i do want to say just before that, this is a project that has also been highlighted and a lot of work is being done by the state government here in victoria. in the same way that over the past year, we've been able to work together to get to the heads of agreement on the melbourne airport rail link, this is a project that dan andrews and i have discussed in our meetings in the past. i know it has been a priority and they've done a lot of work on this project and it's that work that is being done by the state government that enables us, i think, to come together. now the details have obviously got to be worked through, that's no different, just as it was with the melbourne airport rail link, to determine the preferred route and things like that. so i look forward to working with dan andrews on this and we worked well together when it came to the melbourne airport rail link. these two projects connect up together as we said at sunshine station where i stood with the premier just over a week or so ago. so we look forward to working with them and learning from the work that they've already done. i think it'll be a great project. two governments, yes, from different political persuasions, but able to just get on and deliver things for people in victoria.  journalist: what sort of monetary commitment do you require from victoria?  prime minister: it's a 50/50 project.  journalist: and they\u2019ve agreed to that?  prime minister: well this is the discussion we now have. it\u2019s the same arrangement we were able to come to on the melbourne airport rail link, so this is something they've already been doing planning on. they have already put i think around $50 million into doing that work, so i don't think they'd be doing that if they weren't anticipating making major investments in this area, of that order.  journalist: how different is this to matthew guy\u2019s promise last october, it's very similar?  prime minister: what this is, as i said, is part of a national population management plan. that's what this is about. this isn\u2019t just one-off projects, this is a project that is part of many other projects and a plan to manage population growth into the future, that understands to take the pressure off our fast-growing cities, you need be able to improve your links with your satellite cities around the country. whether it's here with melbourne linking up to geelong or in sydney connecting up to newcastle, or connecting up to wollongong or even out west or it's in brisbane connecting up to the sunshine coast or down to the gold coast. these are the areas, in those three major cities in australia, where there is real population pressure, which is putting strains on people's quality of life. you've got to have a plan to deal with all of that; your migration settings; the investments in the social fabric of your community so they grow together, not apart; the planning alignment between state and local governments and the commonwealth government which i put in place last year in december. we went to coag and had great support from all the premiers, including dan andrews here in victoria and of course gladys berejiklian in new south wales, where our coordinated planning in that state has been delivering record infrastructure investments, which i think, has commended her government to re-election tomorrow. just getting on with it and building the infrastructure my home state and her state needs. but we're doing the same thing here in victoria and we'll work closely with the andrews government.  journalist: is $4 billion enough to actually do this though?  prime minister: that's what business cases are for. that's our understanding at the moment and if the costs are greater than that, then we'll have to address that at the time. but you don't get these things started, the train never leaves the station unless people get on board and it starts moving. that's what we're doing here today; $2 billion of serious investment, a business case to be developed, working closely with the state government. that's what makes these things happen. this is where these projects genuinely start. they start right here, right now, by making these commitments and then getting on with it.  journalist: [inaudible] cost nearly $4 billion and is at capacity already. it's actually slower to get from geelong to melbourne now than it was even 50 years ago. surely it's going to cost a lot more?  minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: these were the estimates from our experts in the federal infrastructure department. it involves in essence three components, one from southern cross station to sunshine station and that is being upgraded as part of the $10 billion commitment to the to the airport rail. so that's the first piece. the second piece is from sunshine station to wyndham vale. that would be a duplication of that rail line there and that costs, the experts in the infrastructure department say, about $2 billion. then the remaining amount of money would be for the rest of the rail line which is utilizing the existing rail line, but it needs to be upgraded to be able to go faster. you need better traffic signalling, you probably need some upgrading to the stations as well. so that's the estimate from our experts in canberra. they do estimates right across australia on these types of things, but as the prime minister says, the detailed business case will provide further information. that will be coming to a conclusion soon. the state government has got $50 million towards that and we want to be able to see what that says as well, in order to determine what the final cost will be.  journalist: [inaudible]?\u00a0  minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: so that's the estimate for all of the upgrades, right? so it's going to be as i said, additional tracks from sunshine through to wyndham vale and then upgrading the line, including traffic signalling and looking at some of those things as well.  journalist: that\u2019s not clear, is that a yes or a no?  minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: it basically enables the project to be done so that you get an average speed of 160 kmph. that's what the estimates are based on. it means that you're going faster in some locations, up to 200 kmph and then obviously slowing down if you're stopping at a particular station. but i would expect there would be some express routes as well.  prime minister: what we're doing today is starting the process with serious money down. there will be many decisions that will have to be taken on the detailed planning of this route. when we announced the melbourne airport rail link about this time last year in fact, before the last budget, with real money, we said we had to go through the process, working with the state government, to identify the preferred route and all of these technical questions. now that's the work that now needs to happen. you know, you can't get a fast rail at the drive through, i mean this is not a fast food process we're engaged in here, this is one of the most significant regional rail infrastructure projects that victoria has seen. so we will do the homework with the state and territory governments. we will do the consultation with communities and we will deliver the project together. i understand, there will be many, many questions and they'll have to be resolved through that process. that's why you start a process. that's why you answer those questions in consultation with the community and the partners in the project. then you get on and get the job done. journalist: [inaudible] funding, how soon could we see this happen, if that has still all got to be done? prime minister: well if we have a good run and everybody can work well together - i mean alan was saying yesterday that we could be at the start of construction within a couple of years, if not sooner. but that really depends on how the process unfolds. you've got to commit to the process to get the right answers. this is a piece of infrastructure that will be benefiting people in victoria both in melbourne and here in geelong and corangamite for decades to come. so you want to get the planning right. you want to get it right, you've got to be considered about it and you don't want to rush a start at the risk of actually compromising the usefulness and effectiveness of the project for the longer term. journalist:\u00a0 does this commitment include money for new rolling stock?\u00a0  minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: the estimate of the $4 billion is for the construction of the rail and obviously the rolling stock is the responsibility of state governments. assistant minister for social services, housing and disability services: this is a great celebration for geelong and a great celebration for corangamite. prime minister: and we will work with all good-natured people to get the project done. journalist:\u00a0 the opposition and the state labor government may not have known about this in time to be here?  prime minister: well i gave a heads up to dan last night. this is a long process and we have discussed this project before. so what we're doing today is announcing our intention to commit to this project, $2 billion. then, if further investment is required after business cases, that will be considered at that time. we're starting a process here i look forward to working with dan andrews and the state government to be able to take this project forward. i believe they're committed to it. they wouldn't have put $50 million into a feasibility study if they weren't. just like we've been able to demonstrate on the melbourne airport rail link, our governments can work together and we'll continue to work together. yesterday i was out at racecourse road in pakenham and there, we have a project where the state government is building the flyover and we're widening the road. that's an example, another one, of just the simple planning and cooperation that exists between the state government here in victoria and my government at a national level. that's what people expect. they expect us to work together. they don't expect, you know, people to be turning up and shouting behind announcements like this. [unionists shouting] well, there they go again, right on cue. that's not what australians want, they want australians to work together to deliver important projects like this. journalists: minister just on the fast rail, how frequently would you like to see these trains run?  minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: that will be determined by the business case process, but there is enormous demand already as you probably know. so when the existing trains go from geelong all the way through to the city at the moment, often the people at wyndham vale and tarneit can't get on because they\u2019re already full. that is by the time you get to the edge of the city, they're into densely suburban area and that area of course is growing. so we will need frequent services. i imagine there will be express services as well as some services which will have some stops at some of the larger stations along the way.  journalist: wyndham vale and tarneit is that where they would stop?  minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: that will have to be determined but i can envisage, as i said, you'd have some express services but also some stops along some of the major stations. perhaps at wyndham vale, perhaps at tarneit and perhaps at sunshine.  treasurer: i just want to reinforce, to re-emphasise that as the pm said, this is real money for a real project that will be in our budget to be delivered on april 2. this is a federal commitment for a vital victorian infrastructure project, this is $2 billion in the federal budget for this project to become a reality.  prime minister: on that note josh has to get back to delivering that budget. it's going to be the first surplus budget in 12 years, josh great work. this will be a significant part of the announcements on budget night as part of our plan going forward. i've also got an important job to do today, i've got to get back there and vote for gladys berejiklian back in new south wales and i'm looking forward to doing that. thank you very much. "], "press-conference-canberra-act": ["20 February 2019", "prime minister: well good afternoon, i\u2019m pleased to be joined by minister coleman and minister tudge. this is a very important day, because today we are launching australia\u2019s first commonwealth serious plan to manage population growth into our future. this plan is about protecting the quality of life of australians right across our country, in our urban areas, in our regional parts of the country. its about realising the economic opportunities that are all around the country and it\u2019s about investing in the fabric of our community so we can grow together. at a very practical level, it\u2019s about acknowledging the impacts that are happening in our cities and the opportunities we need to seize in our regional areas. its about understanding that parents want to get home sooner and safer to have time together as a family. the tradies want to spend less time in traffic and more time on site, because that\u2019s where you get paid and to ensure that the congestion that is impacting on our cities is addressed \u2013 not just now but that it\u2019s well-,managed into the future. that congestion and the liveability of cities was one of the key items that was highlighted by the productivity commission in the report into the five year priorities for productivity improvements that i commissioned when i was treasurer. so today\u2019s announcement is about addressing that productivity agenda as well. our population has been a key component of our economic growth. equally that population if not well-managed can retard growth, that is true, with the impacts of congestion. so it is very much about getting the balance right across these various objectives. the plan that i announce today, supported by ministers coleman and tudge, has four key components. the first is ensuring that we have a responsible and well-planned and targeted migration programme. a programme that of course, has integrity and that programme will be capped at 160,000. that programme enables us to pause at that level over the forward estimates, but as always the government has the opportunity to respond to changing circumstances in the future. but it about the forwards, it is about ensuring that the population planning and the infrastructure investments and the working out of the plan that i\u2019m outlining today with ministers, is able to have it\u2019s effect across the country. it\u2019s about incentives, to get people taking up the opportunities outside our big cities and i know much of the discussion is focussed on regional areas but these \u2018outside the big cities\u2019 areas include adelaide, they include darwin, they include hobart, they include newcastle, they include some of our faster growing areas around the country. it\u2019s important that we have the opportunity for people to go where they are needed. over 45,000 job vacancies in regional australia, as alan reminds me regularly, constantly, for rural and regional areas and have been put to the government, through the migration programme and the need to have more workers in those areas. so it\u2019s important that we take the opportunity for our migration programme to play its role in seizing those opportunities. secondly it\u2019s about busting congestion in our cities and ensuring that our cities are well-managed. there are an array of initiatives there, whether it\u2019s the city deals, the most recent we announced yesterday in adelaide, or it\u2019s the congestion-busting infrastructure projects, or the very large scale projects like the tullamarine rail or the north south rail link we\u2019ve recently announced in western sydney to support the western sydney international nancy bird walton airport, these are important projects. it's about planning for the future together, with state and territory and local governments. as you know, last year i took a new approach to population planning, to work closely with the states and territories, to the coag meeting. that was endorsed at that coag meeting and we continue to work together on that framework. that includes importantly, working with local government. as you know, the alga was part of that coag meeting and welcomed that approach to acknowledge the challenges being faced by local governments across the country. under this plan, particularly on the migration programme, as david will run through later the states and territories will go from having just less than a fifth of a say about the annual migration intake into their states, to almost a third. so that is giving them a real role in the migration programme in australia, that they have never had before. finally it's about continuing to invest in bringing australians together. a cohesive society, one where we invest in the social fabric of this country, is one that enables us to support population growth into the future. it is one of australia's most significant successes. sure, we can always do more and we can always do better, but australia is a country that welcomes people from all around the world and our social cohesion and our migration programme makes us the most successful migrant country in the world today. we will not take that for granted and what we're announcing today will further invest in the social fabric as part of a comprehensive plan. so a responsible migration plan, busting congestion in our cities, planning to grow together and bringing australians together to invest in our social fabric; that is the serious plan, the plan for australia's population future, that we're announcing today. i'm going to ask minister tudge to go through some of the data. i know how much you'd like me to take you through data charts from treasury days - shane is giving the nod of approval - but i'm going to allow alan to do that today, to run through the data that has really contributed to the strategy that we've come forward with today and talk about the particular infrastructure components of what we're announcing today. then i'll ask david to go through the more detailed components of the migration changes that we're making today. so, i'll hand you over to alan, thank you. alan tudge: \u00a0\u00a0thanks prime minister. this is a plan to ease the pressure on our big cities, while supporting the growth of the smaller cities and the regions. we've been working on this for many months now and i'd like to take you through at least some of the analysis which has underpinned where we have actually got to. i hope this presentation works, if i press this button, it should come on. that one there, there we go. let's start by looking at this. australia's population is growing fast, but it's always been a relatively fast-growing nation. we're at about 1.6 per cent per annum presently, which is the average since federation. but clearly you can see we've had faster-growing periods of time in the populate or perish policy and also in the roaring \u201820s. we've had an up-tick in particular in the last decade or so, so we're still going along at a reasonably fast pace of 1.6\u00a0 per annum, which is double the rate of the united states and almost triple that of the oecd average. when you look at population growth, there's really only two ways you can grow; through natural increase, because we're having more babies and living longer, which we are doing, and through net overseas migration. we've always been a land of immigrants and so immigration has always been a big part of our population growth. in recent decades, the proportion of our population growth which is due to immigration has actually lifted. so it now sits close to about 60 per cent with about 40 per cent due to births and increasing life expectancy. now, this is perhaps one of the more important slides, that while the growth of australia is relatively quick by international standards, it's particularly fast into three areas; that is in to melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. there, as you can see they're represented by these three bars here, they constitute three-quarters of all of the population growth in the country overall. so those three cities, those three areas, are growing very, very fast, while these other areas, which are growing much more slowly, when in fact want to grow more quickly. in many cases, they're crying out for more people. the prime minister indicated previously that in the regions alone, there are 47,000 job vacancies today, according to the regional australia institute. we know that a place like adelaide, which is down here, the premier wants 15,000 to 20,000 more people each and every year. there are parts of australia where which are literally crying out for more workers. so while we've got very fast growth in the big cities, we've got other parts of the country that do want to grow more quickly. here's just one indication in warnambool, in my home state of victoria, this is the warnambool mayor who says they need 1,000 workers today to fill the job vacancies which they have. that's three or four hours outside of melbourne, a beautiful coastal town. so moving along, when you've got fast-growing population, you need infrastructure to keep up. now, this chart tracks the infrastructure expenditure with what the population growth is. as you can see, it broadly tracks. so the red line there is the infrastructure expenditure. the dark blue line is the population increase and basically they largely track each other. although, you'll see at times - and particularly here, which is sort the mid-2000s to late-2000s, the population did grow well in excess of what the infrastructure expenditure was. interestingly here we have a big up-tick in recent years. that is largely due to the massive investment going on in new south wales where the berejiklian government has done enormous amounts of public infrastructure work there. of course, very strongly supported by our coalition government here federally as well. so while generally it's kept pace there have been moments when it hasn't kept up and of course this is expenditure which doesn't always mean the roads are there, built, ready to be used, sometimes there can be a lag still of a couple of years thereafter. now, what happens if you've got fast-growing populations with the infrastructure not necessarily keeping up? well, you end up with serious congestion and the data backs up what everybody in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland particularly know from daily experience; that is the roads and the rail are getting more and more congested. so here is just one piece of data, when you look at the melbourne traffic times. a decade ago, you could be assured of travelling 30km on the freeway in the morning peak hour and it would take you 39 minutes. a decade later, that's almost taking you an hour. so the freeway speeds is one marker of congestion and they've slowed down considerably and there's some roads, such as the monash in melbourne, which are almost a carpark every single morning. that translates of course, into a serious economic cost as well, which the prime minister mentioned. you can see that we've had congestion costs rising steadily in recent years and on the forecasts, if we do nothing different, it would continue to go up quite, quite heavily according to what the experts would suggest. now another part of this equation as well is if you've got strong population growth which is not being managed well, is that the housing approvals and completions don't always keep up. this is an important chart and what it shows is the ratio of dwelling completions to population change. if you're above the red line, you're basically building more houses than population coming in. if it's below the line, the contrary, your housing developments are not keeping up with your population increase. now, guess what happens if your population increase is running ahead of what your dwelling completion is? your prices spike and that is exactly what has happened of course, in the last decade or so. that\u2019s just another feature of what occurs if you're not managing your population well and making sure you've got your population growth aligned with key services and key approval processes like housing approval and dwelling completions. so that's just a quick snapshot, if you like, of some of the challenges of population growth. now, we're going to flip to say, well, that doesn't necessarily mean that you put the brakes on. you've got to consider the opportunities which strong population growth brings and that is, it does help drive our economy. now, on this chart, the red line is the population growth on an index. the blue line is the real gdp per capita and this is often not, sort of, fully understood. not only does population growth help with gdp growth overall, but it helps with gdp per capita growth too. so it's actually made all of us wealthier. in fact, treasury estimates that 20 per cent of our per capita wealth generated over the last 40 years has been due to population factors. now, how does that come about? well, in part - i'll go to the next slide which sort of explains this - at least in part, because when we bring in migrants, they come in younger than what the average australian is. on average, a migrant comes in at the age of 26. the average age of an australian is about 37. so it very much helps with our workforce participation and that's essentially what is a big driver of our gdp per capita growth. prime minister: just on that, i\u2019d also mention, from a pensions point of view and social welfare point of view - achieving more of a balance in the working-age population means there's more people in the working age to actually pay for the pensions and the welfare bill for those who aren't able to be in the workforce. with an ageing population, that is one of the levers and policy measures you have available to you to address an ageing population. alan tudge: so this has been really important. as you probably know, our government has slightly reduced the age of coming in as well, because we know when people come in as skilled people, as young people, they immediately contribute to the economy and they help everybody else. the other side of the ledger here - so in some respects that talks about your participation rate staying high - this side of the ledger talks about our permanent migration programme and really goes to the fact that it supports our productivity as well. because over time - and this started under john howard - we've slowly increased the proportion of our overall intake to being geared very much around skilled migration. those people that do come in, come in with skills which are higher than the average person of a similar age in australia. so the population factors support our participation rates and they support our productivity. they also support, obviously, businesses being able to grow when they can't find australian workers. i'll go into the next slide, which is really the last slide which we'll show. so that in some respects, that analysis goes to where do we get to now in terms of our plan? this is a recap really of how the prime minister summarised overall. so there's four main elements to our plan. first up, reducing the migration cap and encouraging more migrants to go to the region and david is going to take us through the specifics on that. busting the congestion, which goes with that. working much more closely with the states and territories and bringing the communities together. so basically we're easing the pressure on the big cities and supporting the regions, we're investing heavily into those cities and elsewhere, while we've got the pause going on. making sure we've got proper plans with the states and territories and the local councils so that these sort of problems are better managed in the future. and of course, continuing to invest to ensure we maintain a cohesive society. david, i think you're going to go through the details, particularly around one and four, there's a lot of detail in relation to the specifics there. let me just say very briefly in terms of just addressing number two and number three; we\u2019re busting congestion with investment in our roads and rail, we've been doing a lot of that, particularly in the last couple of years. we've got a $75 billion national program we're investing not only in the major road and rail corridors, but also particularly in the last six months or so, investing in the real pinch points in suburbs across our big cities. those pinch points are important because often you can spend as much time trying to get onto the freeway, as you can actual being held up on the freeway itself. so that's a very important part of this plan and we'll continue to do that sort of work. we've mentioned fast rail briefly in the documents which have been circulated. that will also be part of our population plan as well and of course that can help with the decentralisation agenda, if you connect fast rail to your orbital cities around the big capitals. we'll have more to say about that at a later time. this planning mechanism the prime minister kicked off with coag, saying that we need to much more closely align the levers which we have at our disposal - which largely set the population growth rate - with the responsibilities of the states and territories, who have primary responsibility for the infrastructure, the housing approvals and the like. they need to be much more closely married together and also the states and territories are now having a bigger say over what the population and the migration settings should be. critically, under this as well is the city deals mechanism, which are becoming very important mechanisms to tie the three levels of governments together, to be able to plan better for our bigger cities. now, we just announced the adelaide city deal just yesterday. we've done other city deals, particularly the western sydney one which is a great plan for the development of western sydney, to deal with some of these congestion pressures in advance and getting it right. we're also going to do one in south east queensland over the next 12 months. so they're two elements of the plan. the real details are in number one and four and, david, i think it's over to you now to take us through some of those initiatives. prime minister: thank you, david and thank you alan.  david coleman: thanks, pm, thanks, alan. good afternoon, everyone. this migration plan is about acknowledging that different parts of australia have different immigration needs. a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate, because the immigration needs in sydney and melbourne are very different to the needs in south australia or in tasmania or in so many other parts of australia where there is a real need for additional people to fill un-met demand for skilled jobs. so this is about focusing in on those needs around the country and seeking to ensure that our migration programme is matched to those needs and doesn't impose one solution across the entire nation. so the first point as the pm noted, is that the annual migration cap will be coming down from 190,000 to 160,000. that, over the forward estimates, is a reduction of some 120,000 places. now, that enables us to take some of the pressure off the cities that are experiencing, as alan pointed out, some very significant pressures in terms of the congestion and so on. by reducing the total cap under the programme, we create the opportunity to reduce that pressure. then, very importantly, what we further do is that we will ensure that a greater proportion of migrants settle in regional australia. it's really notable when you go round the country, the differences in the demand for migrants. i was just in south australia this week and there is such a strong desire in south australia for more people to fill the un-met demand for jobs and so on. that's the case in many other parts of the nation as well. so under this plan, what we will be doing is creating 23,000 places within the skilled scheme, where people will be required to live and work in regional australia for a period of three years in order to obtain permanent residency. i just want to explain why this is a very important point; for people who emigrate to australia, permanent residency is at the top of their priority list. it means that you can stay in the country and plan your future in this nation. so by linking the requirement that a person stays in a regional area for three years to their permanent residency, we will see a very, very high level of compliance with that requirement, because if people don't comply, they won't get permanent residency and they will not be allowed to settle in australia. now, at the moment, there is already a scheme under the state and territory nominated system which works in a similar way. about 8,500 people in 2017/18 were under this system, where they had to stay in a regional area for two years in order to obtain a permanent residency. now, the compliance rate with that program, is 99 per cent. that's because permanent residency is such a powerful incentive. so we're doing two things in expanding this concept of provisional permanent residency for regional australia. the first is what is known as the employer-nominated scheme, currently known as the regional sponsored migration scheme. now, under that scheme there are about 6,000 places, there were about 6,000 places in 2017/18. we'll be increasing that to 9,000 places and we'll be requiring that people who come under that scheme, stay in a regional area for three years in order to obtain permanent residency. the second significant change is in relation to the state and territory nominated program. as the pm mentioned, we'll be giving the states and territories the opportunity to increase the number of people that they nominate to come to their state. so that was 8,500 people in 2017/18 and that will be increasing to 14,000 people in 2019/20. so 23,000 people over all will be required to live and work in regional australia if they want to obtain permanent residency. that means they will not be residing in sydney or melbourne or brisbane or the gold coast or perth. so, importantly, that helps to take the population pressure off those centres. now, within regional australia, it's important to understand that people are able to move around under this programme within regional australia. so as i said, regional australia excludes sydney, it excludes melbourne, it excludes perth, it excludes brisbane and the gold coast. those individuals will not be able to settle in those locations. if they do, they will lose their visa and they will not be able to settle in australia. we're also allocating $7 million to increase compliance with these regional rules. people will be required to advise the department of home affairs if they change employers or move and most importantly, at the end of the three years,when they seek to obtain permanent residency, they would need to substantiate that they had, in fact, lived and worked in regional australia for that period of three years. so some very strong compliance measures there which will ensure that people who come under those visas stay in regional areas and which will take the pressure off population growth in our big cities. the other thing that it\u2019s important to point out is that under this plan, there is no reduction in the number of places that can be nominated by employers. so part of our immigration programme, the permanent programme, is that employers can hire a specific individual where there is a skills gap in a particular region and that person can come to australia. now, in 2017/18, there were 35,000 people who employers were able to sponsor into australia. in 2019/20 that number is 39,000, so there's no reduction in the employer-sponsored programme. in fact, there is a modest increase. the other thing i would also like to point out is there is no change to the family program. so in 2017/18, just under 48,000 people settled in australia under the family program and the number in 2019/20 is precisely the same, so just under 48,000 people. so no change to the family program and obviously, people will settle right around the nation in relation to the family program. so this is about ensuring that our migration programme is better matched to the needs of australia. our needs are different in different parts of the country. we know that sydney and melbourne in particular are facing very significant population pressures and we know that places like south australia, tasmania and other parts of australia are literally calling out for more people. so what this plan enables us to do is to deliver on those requests from different parts of australia in relation to their migration intake. it enables us to importantly, take pressure off the cities. prime minister: thank you. do you want to speak to the social cohesion programs, just briefly? david coleman: sure. so over the past several months, the government has been working on a package of social cohesion measures that are aimed to promote, encourage, celebrate multicultural australia and tolerance within our community. today we're announcing $71 million worth of measures in the social cohesion area, which we'll provide the full list of those later today. there are a few i wanted to specifically highlight as part of this announcement. one is a program called together for humanity. this is a really important program that sends people into schools to discuss religious difference, religious tolerance. it has been operating successfully for a number of years. it is so important as a society that we are cognisant and accepting of our differences. religious freedom is so fundamental to this nation and together for humanity does a great job in helping people to understand religious difference and to promote tolerance. they'll be receiving $2.2 million under this program. another important initiative is community languages. it\u2019s really important to note the significance of community languages in australia, especially for kids. there are so many kids out there who do a community language after school, on the weekends. it helps to enable them to learn more about the culture that maybe their parents or grandparents have come from. of course, there are other kids who learn languages that are not their background culture, but also enable them to learn more about the diversity of our nation. so we'll be providing $10 million in funding for community languages schools for grants of up to $25,000 to assist in the development of these important programs. in addition, we'll be having another round of the successful fostering integration grants. these were just run quite recently, grants of up to $50,000 which again, seek to support organisations that are promoting tolerance, education and inclusion in our community. we'll be allocating an additional $3 million to that program as part of this announcement. prime minister: thank you very much, david. just finally, also with student visas, we'll be extending an additional year of working rights for those who come under the international student visa program and study in regional areas, the areas that have been defined. this will do two things. one, it will bring, i think, a much needed boost to a lot of these regional communities with students going in with the spend. it is one of our biggest export earners as an industry and to see that benefit of that sector spread more into the regions will be positive, as well as taking the population pressure off. as i have said repeatedly, if there is ten extra people on the bus, just under four were born here, just over four have turned up on a temporary visa and two have turned up directly on a permanent visa. that's how population growth enters australia. over time that changes, of course, as people move on to other visa classes. so trying to manage also the temporary migration program and support that in its dispersal i think is important. in regional areas there is also 450 additional occupations that are available to regional employers that are not available in those other areas. so there are more opportunities under those regional visa schemes to achieve that. you're also very aware of what we do around the seasonal worker program and the working holiday-maker visa program to support the needs in regional areas as well and we\u2019re going to continue to encourage that. happy to take questions. journalist: just on the 23,000 skilled visas, under the current arrangement they stay for two years. what's the retention rate of people staying in the regions and do you have an estimate or a model of what extending it to three years will do to that retention rate? david coleman: a couple of points. so first point, there's two different programs. there's the state and territory nominated, which is currently 8,500. that goes to 14,000. the proportion of people who comply with that provision is 99 per cent. obviously, once someone has spent a number of years in a regional area, it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of those people will continue to settle in regional areas. then we have the other program which is 6,000, going to 9,000, which is effectively does not currently have an effective regional requirement. so we have an additional 14,000 people who currently don't have a regional requirement in order to obtain permanent residency, who will. permanent residency is top of the list in terms of the incentives for people. so we certainly expect that these will be well subscribed and that there will be a very high level of compliance. prime minister: alan, did you want to add to that? alan tudge: yeah i would just note that the analysis we've looked at previously as well is after five years, more than 80 per cent of people are still in the regions, so who have chosen to go to the regions. people go make it their home, they go there, their kids go to school, they join the local soccer club, netball club, local church and make it their home and that\u2019s what this plan is designed to do. prime minister: when you link up with states and territories and shires and local governments as well, when your migration plan is built around that, then your odds of success increase because you're taking people into areas where they want them to go, where the services are and where there are jobs. journalist: prime minister, minister tudge told us the importance of population growth to gdp growth and also gdp per capita but we're also told there's a 47,000 shortfall in regional skills. why didn't you keep, say, the migration cap at 190,000 and use that extra 30,000 to bolster this program that has 23,000 regional skilled stream? if it's going to be successful why not keep it even bigger and perhaps fulfil that 43,000-person shortfall? prime minister: as you know, as a result of the improvements in our immigration systems in recent years, and it was shown in alan's chart earlier, that the level of permanent residency granted under those permanent visas has fallen in recent years. so what we're doing is basically pausing at that level and redirecting the composition. even at the levels and the targets that we've set now for people to go beyond the capital cities, we know that they are ambitious targets to meet for those areas. it is about pausing the overall level of intake and ensuring the spread of that intake is more targeted to where the jobs and the opportunities are. journalist: prime minister, the presentation\u2026 prime minister: you're waiting patiently there. journalist: the presentation stepped through the contribution that migration has made to economic growth. have you modelled the subtraction from economic growth that the reduction in the permanent residency program will have, and if so what is that number? prime minister: we're not expecting any change. that'll be set out in the budget. as i said at the start of this process, and i should have stressed, when we stood up this process, we formed a cabinet subcommittee which is chaired by the treasurer, who is obviously not here today with us because he is busy writing the budget. so i want to thank josh for his work in leading the taskforce that the ministers have been involved here. the whole point here is to do two things. yes, to pause the overall level of permanent intake, which is basically running at those current levels on actuals. but also to address the impacts on the economy of congestion. there is population growing too quickly in parts of the country where there is too much congestion, which the productivity commission showed actually is a drag on productivity and is a drag on growth. that's why i described this as a serious but very balanced plan. so we can actually move to this level without impacting on the budget and i think without impacting on growth and continuing to maintain the momentum of that growth. journalist: so does the economic gain of reducing congestion offset the economic subtraction from reducing the intake? prime minister: the impact of this plan is to have no negative impacts on our growth prospects. katharine. journalist: just on that regional-sponsored migration scheme, forgive me if this is not right - but i think it is right - there's 22,000 people currently in the pipeline for that scheme. so, if moving people to the regions is such a priority, why are those people in the pipeline, what\u2019s going on. and just not on a point of policy but a point of logic, i know you've said to us that permanent residency is the carrot for moving people or requiring a three year residency rather than two. but it is a strange incentive, isn't it, to increase the time you have to be in the region in order to get permanent residency? it's not really an incentive, is it? it\u2019s sort of\u2026 well, the hurdle is greater before you get permanent residency, which brings me back to the prime minister\u2019s point which is that a minute ago, it\u2019s an ambitious target for 23,000 right, for that cohort. so if you don\u2019t meet your own target, what happens? does the overall number under the permanent program fall? prime minister: well, let me address those matters and david can comment on them also. first of all, just because someone has an application, it doesn't mean it'll be approved. there are lots of applications. what we have seen, particularly in recent years, is the integrity of our processes and the improvements in those mechanisms which home affairs has put in place, has meant that fewer of the applications have actually been approved. we have high standards and we'll continue to have those standards, and an application existing does not mean that that is a pending approval. and we'll continue to follow that path. in terms of the issue of two to three years, this is about having the opportunity for people to put further roots down over that period of time. and so, rather than, i think, being a disincentive, i think it only enhances the incentive for people to commit further to where they are locating and settle themselves and their families in the jobs they are in and seek further opportunities in those towns or wherever they may be, or in that city. the purpose of permanent residency is a very, very attractive one because of course it leads to citizenship, which is the ultimate club to be in and so we do not consider that as any impediment or any lack of encouragement. remind me of your last point, katharine? journalist: you referenced a minute ago that 23,000 in relation to andrew\u2019s is a difficult benchmark to reach\u2026 prime minister: remember, this is a cap. it is not a target. just like 190,000 has previously been the cap, not the target. when i became immigration minister back in 2013, these things used to be targets. they tried to fill it. they used to try to find applicants to approve to meet the targets for the immigration department. now, that changed. we changed that. as a government, we changed that some years ago. so that means that it is there as a cap. it's there as a ceiling but the standard of applications that they have to meet is unchanged. and so, there are no performance bonuses for people to approve visa applications in the department of home affairs. there's a simple standard. as part of this package there is investment in new systems also to support the visas that will be granted. and in particular there'll be enhanced visa processing for regional areas and a regional migration hub to undertake outreach activities, support regional employers and local authorities to navigate the visa system. we're also investing in the process of how people might see the region as an opportunity. but david, did you want to add? david coleman: a little while ago we $19 million in additional investment related to regional processing, a significant component is increased emphasis on regional processing. so basically to proritise regional processing. so what that means is that some of those people in that pipeline, \u00a0the ones who comply with the rules, will be processed more quickly, which will assist in achieving the target of 9,000. in relation to the 14,000, which is the second component of the regional target, so these roles are nominated by states and territories. as i mentioned earlier, we're in a discussion with the states and territories about their needs, in particular, locations. we estimate that that 14,000 number will be met through their requests. so we think the 23,000 can be achieved. prime minister: we'll go over here and then we'll come back to you. journalist: prime minister, you mentioned earlier there are a couple of election buses winding their way through new south wales at the moment. how much of that election has put into your mind the timing of today's announcement? prime minister: none. journalist: nothing to do with what's going on in new south wales? prime minister: no. we started this process last year. we stood the taskforce up soon after i became prime minister and i highlighted this as a very significant issue i wanted to address as prime minister. the end bookmark\u2026 the end mark on this is the budget. that requires us to actually frame the migrant intake under the permanent program to be included in the budget. the budget's less than a fortnight away. so this was always the timeframe. yes? journalist: prime minister, just a particular interest for our audience. they're asking when you speak about compliance measures, what does that mean? are we talking about a population police going door-to-door to check where people are staying, what does it look like? and migrants are quite concerned about how that might impact their experience in australia. the second question if you\u2019ll allow is the federation of ethnic communities council of australia has said particularly given what has happened in christchurch this week, it is irresponsible and erroneous to link congestion to migration. can you reassure migrants they're not to blame for these challenges that we\u2019re facing? we saw very clearly in slide six that government has not invested in infrastructure that is needed and it\u2019s not their fault. prime minister: sure. i'm happy to reassure them on that point. australia's immigration program has been one of the most important pillars of our prosperity and success. and our migrant communities, from whichever part of the world they come from, it is just a consistent story of success. one of the things i enjoy doing most in this role and previous roles has been to attend annually, where i can, the ethnic business awards, which now includes indigenous businesses. it is a true story of remarkable achievement and often times quite teary stories about what people have been able to achieve. indeed, we've had a habit at each of these events to honour all of those who've created these amazing businesses over the course of their life. migrant communities and migrants to australia have a higher level of entrepreneurship and business ownership, self-employed work than other any other cohort of the country. the real success of australia's immigration, and why i say we are the most successful immigrant country on earth, is because on all the key metrics - educational attainment, employment, small business ownership, when it comes to the justice system - all of these things, when you look at the migrant versus non-migrant population in australia, it just achieves either at the same standard as the rest of the population or, indeed, for many communities, even better. so migration and those who have come to australia to make a contribution, not take one, has been an enormous boon for australia we want to continue to encourage that. you're right, it is about planning for population growth, which is what we're talking about today. as i said on monday in my speech to the australia-israel chamber of commerce, any conflation of this debate certainly with the terrorist atrocities last week, it's just not on. there's no connection between these things whatsoever. this is about dealing with practical issues. i expressed on monday my great frustration that in addressing these issues of population, and immigration programs, that these debates so often get hijacked by those of competing views who seek to exploit them for other causes. now, i reject all of that absolutely. this is a practical problem that australians want addressed, that migrant communities wanted addressed. and so by ensuring we have both the migration programs that are responsible, the infrastructure programs that are responsible and forward-looking, and the planning processes that are inclusive, and the social cohesion programs which build on the success of our social fabric, well, that's all win. journalist: prime minister, a number of your queensland mps have come out publicly today saying they don't want pauline hanson last on the ticket in queensland. they think\u2026 prime minister: can we finish talking about population? if people have questions on population policy issues - i'll deal with politics later. i'll deal with policy first. shane? journalist: pm, i'm just wondering 160,000? why not 170,000? why not 150,00, or lower? how did you come to 160,000? is there modelling around 160,000? prime minister: yes, there is. if we were to take the figure below 160,000, then that would have had a direct fiscal impact on the budget. this is the nominated level where the program is constructed where we would not experience that impact on the budget. so that's obviously sensible. it caps it, as we've talked about today, at a pause level, which is where the program has been directing. it has been at 190,000 for some time. i think it makes sense to take it back to the levels on or about that we've been projecting at and experiencing. so we have considered a range of options here and we think this is the most balanced and the most sensible. journalist: can you just explain how the states get a greater say? is it simply by being able to nominate more migrants that they want coming to their state, or is it the way the states are engaging with the commonwealth on this issue as well? david coleman: alan, do you want to talk to the population aspects? alan tudge: \u00a0the answer to question is both. so david will be able to talk about right now what's happening with the state-nominated scheme. more broadly, we're working through the coag process where the states have a much greater role overall in setting up what the migration program should look like going forward. ideally, as i said before, we need to make sure that you're marrying up your population growth rates, which largely we set through the migration settings, with your infrastructure, your housing approvals, your services and the like which the states and territories have primary responsibility for. they need to be completely in sync. if they're not in sync, you end up with some of the issues that we talked about where housing is not being approved in time, the infrastructure is falling behind, and the like. so that's what we're working on and the prime minister is leading that through the coag process, and there's still more work to do on that. prime minister: we've had great support from the states and territories, but there is still more work to do. david? david coleman: in terms of the migration program, the process is that we ask the states what are their needs, for the state and territory migration program. we're basically saying, \"here's a significant increase to the allocations you'll be able to take on\", and being very responsive to those requests from different states. so it is about working together and thinking about future of the country in terms of the broader migration program over a number of years. prime minister: still on this topic? journalist:what has been done to actually vet employers who want to sponsor migrants? in south australia there was an example of one migrant who was currently waiting to find out about his future. he went to a regional city, being murray bridge. he worked for an employer who then ripped him off, about $7 an hour. he is now facing deportation because he wanted to provide for his family, got a new job. obviously breaching his visa conditions, no doubt about that. what is being done to actually vet employers so they are suitable and we know they won't treat our migrants poorly? david coleman:project cadena has been running for some time which is focused on precisely that issue. and we also have recently the report by professor fels in relation to these matters and the bottom line is any behaviour of that kind is completely unacceptable, they are criminal offences and people are prosecuted, as they should be. the reality is, unfortunately, there has been exploitation in some industries. but project cadena is focused on going after those employers through australian border force and we\u2019ll continue to be. journalist:\u00a0just a question about compliance, what can migrants expect in terms of policing where they're living? prime minister: i'll let david mention that, speak to that. the point is here at the end of the day, there is a strong self-assessment process to this because people need to demonstrate where they have been. through people\u2019s own records, where their addresses have been and where their power bills are, and all of these sorts of things. their employment records, their tax file numbers - all these sorts of things - we have a pretty reasonable understanding of where people have been and where they've been living. so the suggestion of some sort of walking the beat enforcement arrangement here is obviously ridiculous. that's certainly not what we have in mind. it is a far more, i think, practical and more cost-effective way of just working cooperatively. david coleman:yes, and the bottom line is, at the end of the three years, when you want your permanent residency, you need to be able to substantiate that you lived and worked in regional areas. permanent residency is, as i said, the absolute top priority. and so people have a very, very strong incentive to ensure that they comply or they won't get pr. alan tudge: \u00a0\u00a0this is not radically new either. we've already had some geographically restricted visas already. it is not a radically new concept here. it is expanding what we've been doing. prime minister: \u00a0on this topic, i haven't forgot you, sam, don't worry. journalist: so if a skilled migrant comes out, minister coleman, and ends up with a shonky employer for example who shifts away from, say, bennellaland and goes to kalgoorlie, then they\u2019ll still be... prime minister: well, kalgoorlie is still within a regional location. journalist: yep, so as long as it's with regional - prime minister: outside the big cities. to maintain the flexibility in that, i think is really important. otherwise it becomes an unworkable program. i've very much appreciated the extensive questions on the policy topic. sam? "], "doorstop-pakenham-vic": ["20 February 2019", "jason wood mp, member for la trobe: thanks everyone, it\u2019s fantastic to be here in my electorate of la trobe in the suburb of pakenham and i thank the prime minister very much again for his visit here today, his second trip in recent times. to alan tudge who is actually now on his third trip in pakenham and tudgey grew up in pakenham, so has been here many times before. to councillor graeme moore and also councillor ross, to colin here, mayor of cardinia. we've been working very closely on congestion-busting in the south east. can i first of all say, the great news is when it comes to the monash freeway, we committed $1 billion back in march 2016, so a $1 billion dollar proposal, $500 million federal funding. stage 1 has been completed, that's from clyde road to the south gippsland highway. the second stage is south gippsland highway to warragul road and from clyde road right out into cardinia road. recently also, we announced with alan tudge, money - after a visit from the prime minister \u2013 for mcgregor road off-ramps. the money has been fully committed. also when it comes to the monash, the great news is that the beaconsfield interchange, that project starts at the end of this year. again, the pm has been there and that sees the creation also of 10,000 jobs in the city. but the fantastic news here today is, we're fully committing $70 million dollars to racecourse road for an extra lane going right across the princes highway and down to henry road. this is a very exciting announcement and can i again personally thank both alan tudge and of course the prime minister for being here today and joining us in la trobe.  thank you, thank you jason. it's great to be here in la trobe and with our local government partners and of course alan tudge the minister for congestion-busting. now today we're making these announcements, but before i do that let me say a couple of things. it's great to be here in melbourne again at the opening of the afl season. it's obviously a very exciting day for everybody in victoria, i'm looking forward to along to the match this evening. it's also great to be here on harmony day. harmony day is a day we celebrate that we have the most successful immigrant country anywhere on earth today, the most successful multicultural country of any country on the earth today. i particularly want to commend jason on the great work that he does here in his local community here in la trobe, whether it's working with a local sri lankan or the indian community and recently the funding we announced for the sikh games which has been a key issue for bringing people together. you know, we're a stronger country when we invest in the social fabric of our nation. that makes us a more prosperous country and makes us a safer country and it means that as our country grows, we grow together, we don't grow apart. so happy harmony day to everyone. i know my girls this morning, back in sydney, they'd be going off to school for harmony day which will be in schools all across the country today. it's a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the great strength that comes from our strong immigrant nation. now yesterday, minister tudge and i with minister coleman announced our serious plan to manage population growth in australia, into the future. we\u2019ve benefitted a lot from the growth that we have experienced, but as we also know, that growth can have some growth pains attached to it. we know that is the case here across melbourne. that's why we've been investing in projects here, particularly in the electorate of la trobe with jason. $500 million on the monash freeway, a very significant part of that, but the programme we have to manage population growth into the future, is not only ensuring we have migration settings that are responsible, but also to ensure that we have the investment in congestion-busting infrastructure that can improve the quality of life and protect that standard of living all across our big cities. that's what we're here to announce today. better coordination with state and local government authorities, that's on display today and ensuring we're investing in the social fabric and social cohesion of our country, so we can grow together as i said. that's on display today as we celebrate harmony day and other initiatives we've been announcing. today we're announcing $70 million dollars here for this important congestion-busting project. this is a programme which alan can speak to more specifically, but whether it's the monash freeway or here where we are today, this is about ensuring that people get home sooner and safer to their families. it's about ensuring that tradies can get on site, because you don't get paid for sitting in a traffic jam. you get paid for being on site and that's true for small family businesses out there as well. so these projects make our cities more liveable. they make our cities more efficient, which is good for our economy and enables us to grow together. $330 million dollars we have delivered and we have committed to urban congestion projects here in victoria. a third of our entire fund, is being committed to projects here in victoria. why? because this is where the congestion has to be busted. when i appointed alan tudge to be the minister for congestion-busting, i wanted someone with melbourne eyes, to put on a melbourne problem. that's what alan's experience has done, growing up in pakenham, understanding uniquely the challenges being faced in our suburbs, as jason does. these projects deliver on our plan to manage population growth into the future and i want to welcome alan here to make a few comments on this particular project. the hon alan tudge mp, minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population:thank you prime minister, jason, mayor and others. this is a great congestion-busting project in one of the fastest-growing areas of australia. as the prime minister and jason were saying, i grew up here in pakenham. when i grew up in the early 70s, it was a small town of 2,000 or 3,000 people. i was in fact born in a hospital called the pakenham bush nursing hospital. today this town is 50,000 people and is expected to grow another 20,000 people when east pakenham is developed in the next few years. so, extraordinary growth and with that growth though does come congestion pain. so this project\u2019s $70 million dollars will ease one of the real congestion hotspots here in pakenham. the congestion hotspot we're talking about is right here on racecourse road and this particular project\u2019s $70 million dollars is going to fix up the on-ramps at the freeway exchange there with racecourse road, so that people can get onto racecourse road more simply. because presently you have a bank-up because of people getting onto racecourse road. you can often have a 500 meter bank-up and that means it's dangerous on the freeway. then there\u2019s going to be a duplication all the way down as far as to the railway line down there. this particular intersection here with bald hill road is going to be fixed. now that intersection is a particular congestion hotspot, it has 20,000 cars going through it each and every day. it will soon have 32,000 cars according to projections from the council. so we are fixing up that interchange, that intersection as well. of course it works hand-in-glove with what the state government is doing, because they're doing the fixing up of the railway line there, so that there will be a bridge going over racecourse road rather than a level crossing as such. so this works hand-in-glove that. the end result of it, $70 million, fully funded, it means that this will be another congestion-busting project that we get completed. it means that people will be able to get to work more quickly, get home at night and spend more time with their families. can i particularly thank jason wood for his work on this, he has been an incredible advocate for this project. he's worked very closely with the cardinia shire council in developing this project and they've been great partners in this as well and i'd like to thank them. they're dealing with extraordinary growth down here and they need our assistance. we are delivering that assistance with projects like this to make it easier for everyday families here in pakenham and further afield.  thank you alan. i\u2019m going to invite up the mayor, graeme, who has done a lot of advocacy on this project, working with jason. cr graeme ross, mayor of cardinia:thank you prime minister and thank you jason wood for the generous funding that we've been waiting for a long time in pakenham. this is a community project that has been \u2013 we\u2019re ready to do this straight away. what a great result we\u2019re going to have for our community here in pakenham. there is safety, there\u2019s upgrades to quality and i want to thank you alan and thank you prime minister for being here today. we\u2019re stoked. i don\u2019t need to go on about it, i just want to thank our staff who have worked tirelessly to get this down on the ground today and we\u2019re shovel-ready. we are ready to do this project. we can\u2019t wait for it to get underway.  well thanks graeme, i\u2019m stoked too. [laughter] prime minister: well, the other thing that is actually really impacting on melbourne has been the impact of housing not being able to keep up with population growth, as well. it's important - as alan was pointing out in our population growth strategy presentation yesterday - that we need to see the housing industry continue to do well. what we've heard today from is sqm research is they have released independent research today which has said what the impact will be of labor's housing tax. now that housing tax, or getting rid of negative gearing as we know it and putting up the capital gains tax, we all know what that means for people's house prices right across melbourne. but what many renters won't understand is what that research shows today is that rents here in melbourne could rise by as much as 15 percent. now if you're fortunate enough to be paying say 500 bucks a week when it comes to a two bedroom flat or a house, then you'll be paying somewhere up to or around $4,000 extra a year. obviously more than that if your rent is much bigger than that, or you have the need for a larger property. labor's housing tax will punish everybody, whether you own an investment property or not, whether you rent or whether you buy, whether you're an investor or you\u2019re a first home buyer. labor\u2019s housing tax will hurt all of you. it will also hurt you if you're out there working in the residential construction industry, costing tens of thousands of jobs every year. that's what the independent research says; this is a very dangerous policy, a housing tax, to be putting on the growth of australian cities. it will slow down construction and mean that those who are trying to live with expanding population growth, will only have to suffer further difficulty because of those sort of pernicious taxes that labor want to put on our cities and our homeowners and our renters. journalist: if this if there is a change of government, will this project go ahead?  prime minister: this money is committed in the budget. the labor party would have to strip it out of the budget. but our plan is to ensure they would never get that opportunity. they should not have that opportunity, because what jason wood has demonstrated here in la trobe is, he promises and he delivers. $500 million for the monash freeway, or funding for sikh games to support local communities. or indeed $70 million dollars here from racecourse road. we are investing - and i should stress also we're working closely together with the victorian state government, it was just last week i stood together with the victorian premier out at sunshine and announced that we'd signed our deal when it comes to development of the melbourne airport rail link, the tulla rail. now, we're working together on projects and i acknowledge the work of victorian state government here, with the flyover they\u2019re putting over the rail line here. good for them. we're all going to work together to make sure we manage population growth into the future and i can assure you as prime minister i will work closely with the victorian state government, every state government regardless of what their political persuasion is, because i just want to get stuff done. journalist: is there any state money in this project?  there is no requirement to start this project, we\u2019re fully funding this. they've put their investment into the flyover and we welcome it, working together to fund important components of this project - to deliver the outcome which is to bust congestion. journalist: how long is it predicted to take?  i might ask the mayor or the minister to address that issue. minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population: the money is in fact from last year's budget, so it is there, ready to be deployed and as soon as that can be scoped up and delivered, we've got the money ready to go. journalist: so this isn\u2019t a re-announcement then? minister: no.  prime minister: no, it\u2019s not. i announced in the budget last year, a $1 billion congestion fund. we have been going through the process as of last year's budget, of committing those funds to specific projects. in that budget, there was no detailing of any of the projects and so what we have done, over the course of the last year is, we have worked closely with our local members to allocate that money to the projects of greatest need in breaking the bottlenecks in our cities. this is a key one which jason has highlighted and we're backing in with $70 million. so it's real money, it\u2019s right there. it\u2019s ready to go, the cheque is ready to be signed. journalist: on another issue, have you spoken to the turkish president directly or do you intend to speak to him directly about his comments? prime minister: let me make a couple of comments on this issue. overnight progress has been made on this issue. overnight we have already seen a moderation of the president\u2019s views expressed in an article in the washington post today. i welcome the moderation in those views. there have been further meetings held between our officials and the turkish government and that\u2019s the appropriate place for those to be held. there\u2019s an oic meeting taking place over the next few days and the new zealand foreign minister will be there, our ambassador to saudi arabia will be attending at that meeting and there will be opportunities for further discussion. but as i said yesterday, it\u2019s my intention here to break any cycle of recklessness. to work through these issues practically, to register in the strongest and clearest of terms, the offence that was taken \u2013 i believe rightly \u2013 by those comments yesterday, but now, to work constructively. i want to stress again that australia and turkey, the peoples of both countries have a tremendous relationship built up over generations. the turkish-australian community, you\u2019ll find no finer community in australia, one of the many, many migrant communities that have built australia. so those issues, i think are quite separate. this is a matter that i\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to resolve and be able to work through in the best interests of the wonderful relationship that we have had with turkey over a long period of time. so we\u2019re making progress. journalist: so would you follow the new zealand lead and send the foreign minister [inaudible] talks? prime minister: well he is attending a meeting that he was already scheduled to attend and i\u2019ve been in contact, in discussions with the new zealand prime minister as well last night. we were discussing a number of issues including our joint efforts to promote social media companies taking responsible action in terms of the posting of extremist material. i spoke to the japanese prime minister last night also on this topic, to shinzo abe. he is the president of the g20 and i\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re being able to progress that issue also with our officials to see if we\u2019re able to take that forward at the osaka summit. so a lot of progress made overnight on all of these issues. our officials are doing the jobs that they\u2019re paid to do, they\u2019re the professionals and we\u2019re making a lot of progress. but i think it\u2019s very important that yesterday australia registered our views very, very clearly and unambiguously and my colleagues know, i\u2019m quite well-known for that. i think i made the point. journalist: do you feel the president has [inaudible] regretted what he said?  prime minister: well i\u2019ll allow the process to follow before making any further comment. journalist: did the government seek clarification through official, i guess, diplomatic channels before you hauled in the ambassador and publically blasted the president?  prime minister: there was a series of advice that i took before both the meeting with the turkish ambassador, which included direct consultation through our embassy in ankara. journalist: australians will travel to gallipoli for anzac day, do you expect those aussies who travel there now will be safe from [inaudible]?  prime minister: well the department of foreign affairs and trade is still reviewing the travel advice. when they conclude that process, we\u2019ll make our announcement. i have welcomed some of the more positive statements about the safety of australians travelling, from the turkish government overnight. i have welcomed that, but i still think we still have a bit more distance to travel. journalist: do you say they should go ahead and book, if they have - prime minister: well, let\u2019s just wait for the official travel advice, i\u2019m not going to make any further comment on that. i think the prudent thing to do is to go through the proper process and make the proper assessment. journalist: labor announced today they'd be looking to invest $2.8 billion into high speed rail from melbourne up to brisbane, is that something that is on the government's agenda and what do you make of that? prime minister: i find it very hard to take the opposition seriously when they talk about projects like that. i mean, we are building the inland rail now, that's actually what we're doing now, that\u2019s our record. a melbourne to brisbane fast rail link is a very ambitious program and the wherewithal to do that and the timeframes around that, i think the opposition should be very clear about. we're focusing on projects that we know are going to make a big difference to people right here and now and that's racecourse road. so i mean, that's going to make a difference to people living here in pakenham, right here, right now. our congestion-busting projects are focused on that. but then, our visionary projects - the melbourne airport rail link, a $10 billion dollar programme that we're doing together with the victorian government - that is city-changing infrastructure. the north-south rail link that we're putting in place in new south wales and the western sydney international airport, the nancy bird walton airport, these are projects that labor didn't move on for generations. but our government is moving on and making it happen and that includes the inland rail. that is a project that has been around for a long time, but it has taken our government to make it happen. it has taken our government to build snowy 2.0. it has taken our government to step up and make sure that we can see a second interconnector between tasmania to get hydro power from tasmania into victoria and into melbourne, to ensure that we don't see the brownouts that we've seen on previous occasions. so our government has a $75 billion dollar infrastructure plan that is being rolled out and has been for years, that is driving our economy forward. it is busting congestion and improving the living standards of all australians. journalist: prime minister, the baby that was abandoned in perth? do you believe it\u2019s time, like in europe and the united states where we change our laws to encourage mothers that don\u2019t want babies to [inaudible]?  first of all, my thoughts frankly are with the young child, the infant and that they are placed in the best of care. i have absolutely no doubt that is what has occurred. the western australian government has the processes and systems in place to provide that care. i also have concern for the mother as well and that the right supports are being placed around her, if she is able to be identified and for the issue to be handled sensitively. so today i think, that's where my thoughts are and there will be time to consider other matters, i'm sure. but right now my thoughts are with the child and the mother. journalist: can i get your thoughts, you\u2019re in melbourne -\u00a0  i\u2019m backing richmond, i\u2019m in melbourne and i\u2019m backing richmond tonight. i\u2019m not an afl fan, i don\u2019t follow it all the time but you can pick my tips, you can see them all there. i\u2019m in it to win it. journalist: and the female carlton player, the shot of a goal - i imagine - with the leg up high. she was trolled online. have you seen that photo?  yeah i have and it's a great photo. i think it's a cracker photo.\u00a0 journalist: and what do you think of these so-called trolls getting on board and saying despicable things?  i think they\u2019re grubs. i think they're cowardly grubs who need to wake up to themselves. you know, trolls on social media, they\u2019re nothing new these days sadly. but i think what is horrible is those trolls tend to target women. they tend to be the target for an inordinate share of the abuse that happens online. i think that's a shameful indictment on the grubs who get on there. i mean i don\u2019t know what's up with them, like, would they say to anyone\u2019s face? no, they haven't got the guts to do that, they're cowards, they're weak. they are acting out some sort of hatred, in a way which really just lessens them as people and they just need to wake up to themselves. we should give them no quarter and we should treat them as the grubs they are. journalist: just one more, do you support the adani mine project in queensland?\u00a0  we support mining right across the country, we think mining is great for australian jobs. it's great for australian jobs right across the country. journalist: fraser anning has spent nearly $35,000 flying his family around the country last year, that is within his entitlements, but do you think that's reasonable?  i think he's had enough oxygen, i'm not going to give him any more. thank you. "], "abc-melbourne-interview-jon-faine": ["20 February 2019", "jon faine:\u00a0 the prime minister and his colleagues are out today trying to reset some their policies in time for the looming federal election. the new south wales state election is on saturday and the federal election campaign will pretty much launch straight off the back of it, and we\u2019ll be going to the polls in the first couple of weeks of may by all accounts and speculation. alan tudge is the federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population and population is one of the big announcements in the federal kind of shadow campaign today. alan tudge, good morning to you. alan tudge: good morning, jon. jon faine:\u00a0what is the coalition announcing as their policy for the next election on population today? alan tudge: so we\u2019re today announcing our plan to better manage our future population growth and in essence, it consists of three parts. one being to reduce the migration rate and provide further incentives for new migrants to go to the smaller cities or regions. second, more congestion busting infrastructure and third, a better plan \u2013 better planning with the states and territories to better link up our population growth and infrastructure. jon faine:\u00a0so better than you yourselves have been doing for the last six years while you\u2019ve been in power? alan tudge: well, one of the challenges with our federation is that we control the major growth lever \u2013 population growth lever \u2013 which is the migration rate while the state and territories have the major responsibility for delivering the services and infrastructure\u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] but you\u2019re talking about population, you just ran through three things that you\u2019re going to do better. alan tudge: [talks over] yeah. jon faine:\u00a0 why haven\u2019t you been doing [indistinct] in power already? alan tudge: [talks over] we want to better align those things. so we\u2019ve been going through the coag process to do that. jon faine: [interrupts] don\u2019t try and blame the states minister. this is a federal responsibility, it\u2019s your job. alan tudge: no. i\u2019m not trying to blame the states. we\u2019ve got a three-part plan to this as i said. let\u2019s go through each if you\u2019d like to. the first one is reducing the migration rate and creating incentives for new migrants to also go to the smaller cities in the regions\u2026. jon faine: [interrupts] now, reducing from what to what? alan tudge: so, from 190,000 down to 160,000. jon faine: a hundred and ninety target. when was that last reached? alan tudge: that\u2019s right. so the 190,000 cap has been in place for several years\u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] i didn\u2019t ask about the cap\u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] last year\u2026. jon faine: \u2026 i asked you about when it was last reached. alan tudge: yeah. last year, we came \u2013 we brought it down to 162,000, the lowest level in a decade\u2026 jon faine:\u00a0 [talks over] so you\u2019re going from 162,000 to 160,000, that\u2019s hardly worth announcing. alan tudge: \u2026and then we\u2019re bringing it down to 160 and holding it there as the cap (for) \u00a0the next four years. jon faine: [talks over] you can\u2019t seriously say to the australian people that you\u2019re changing the immigration target from 162,000 to 160,000. alan tudge: [talks over] no. but we\u2019ve\u2026 jon faine: \u2026and expect that anyone thinks that\u2019s worth even talking about, can you? alan tudge: let me finish jon. so we brought it down already to 162, we\u2019re maintaining the pause at 160 for the next four years and on top of that, we\u2019re allocating 23,000 places specifically for the smaller cities and the regions which need\u2026 jon faine:  [interrupts] okay. you yourself and scott morrison when he was immigration minister argued that we need to maintain significant population growth if we\u2019re to have economic growth and prosperity. why the sudden change of heart? alan tudge: well, we\u2019ve got a balance here and it's right that immigration has underpinned some of our economic success. at the same time, we've got very serious congestion in our big three capital cities where all the new people go, so\u2026 jon faine:  [talks over] so deal with infrastructure. because you people haven\u2019t built anything for the last six years you\u2019ve been in power. alan tudge: \u2026well, and this is [indistinct] \u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] like daniel andrews got elected in a landslide. have you got the message? alan tudge: and john, our plan is a combination of the three things. to ease up in terms of population growth in the big capitals particularly, build more infrastructure in the meantime, and have a better planning mechanism so that we're better able to cope into the future. jon faine:\u00a0your infrastructure plan for melbourne in victoria has seemed to be anything you can do to help the state liberals get elected, you\u2019ll do, but anything that helps the actual government to govern in victoria, you won't do. so it was all a mistake. alan tudge: well, i think that is ridiculous thing to say jon. i mean that\u2019s more ridiculous than many of the things that you say. jon faine: no it\u2019s not. alan tudge: i mean just last week, we were standing there; the prime minister, myself and premier andrews announcing a $10 billion plan for the airport rail link. now, that is going to be a joint exercise; it\u2019ll be built by the states but we put $5 billion dollars on the table to make it happen. jon faine:\u00a0after the last state election result, you suddenly started to think: oh whoops, we better change a couple of things \u2026 alan tudge: [interrupts] no, no, no, no jon. that's wrong - that's wrong because we put $5 billion dollars in last year's budget. we also put $1.6 billion dollars into the northeast link, which is the priority project for the state government as well. in the last year\u2019s budget jon\u2026 jon faine:\u00a0[interrupts] sure, please don\u2019t shout at me minister. please, it\u2019s a conversation. less shouting would be good. when you say you want people to work and live in regional australia, there's no jobs there are there? and the jobs that are there are unskilled so why should skilled workers go to regional australia? alan tudge: in fact there\u2019s 47,000 job vacancies in the regions today but what we're talking about is not just in the regions, but also\u2026 jon faine:\u00a0 [talks over] unskilled. alan tudge: no, no. across the board. but what we're talking about is not just the regions but also some of the smaller cities like adelaide, like darwin, like hobart, et cetera. jon faine:\u00a0 [interrupts] darwin has massive unemployment since the gas plant shut down. alan tudge: and so you\u2019ve got places\u2026 jon faine:\u00a0 hobart\u2019s got work for people in tourism but that\u2019s not skilled work. alan tudge: and so jon you've got- so you've got places like warrnambool which has a thousand job vacancies today, you've got places like dubbo which has a 2.2 per cent unemployment rate and you've got the goldfields which want 10,000 people. you've got adelaide where the premier is saying they want 20,000 more people; you've got estimates of regional vacancies of 47,000 people\u2026 jon faine: [talks over] in agriculture and the like, how are you going to enforce this? alan tudge: \u2026so this is the challenge that our country \u2013 this is the challenge for the country because whereas three quarters of all of our population growth has been going into melbourne, sydney and southeast queensland. but on the other hand, we've got places crying out for more people and so this is what our plan is partly aimed at doing\u2026 jon faine: [talks over] so how are you enforcing that? alan tudge: \u2026it\u2019s just easing the pressure on those big cities. jon faine: [talks over] what are you going to do? remove people from (the regions), if people breach their visas and go to the capital city are you going to arrest them? alan tudge: no jon. i mean this is not, in some respects it\u2019s not a radical idea what we\u2019re proposing because we already do this on a smaller scale where you have geographically conditioned visas, i.e. you have to be in one of the regional areas or a smaller city for a certain number of years in order to guarantee your permanent residency later on. jon faine: how do you enforce it? alan tudge: and we\u2019re boosting up that, we\u2019re boosting up that number to 23,000. jon faine: [talks over] how do you enforce it minister? alan tudge: and it\u2019s basically- yeah, so let me finish. you have basic checking to ensure that you can check with the ato records about where their employment is, you can check in terms of their addresses or electricity bills, the normal things which you supply in terms of where you\u2019re living. jon faine: who\u2019s going to do those checks? alan tudge: again- again- well the department of home affairs already does those checks. jon faine: no they don\u2019t. alan tudge: it\u2019s not a radical concept. jon faine: they don\u2019t. alan tudge: we already do- we already- well we already do these things. jon faine: they\u2019ve got delays that have blown out from processing permanent visa applications. alan tudge: [talks over] jon. jon. jon faine: it\u2019s already taken years for people to have a citizenship application processed. alan tudge: [talks over] jon. jon faine:so who\u2019s going to do this? alan tudge: we- it\u2019s- jon we already do these things on a smaller scale \u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] well, i\u2019m sorry, you don\u2019t. that\u2019s just not true, you don\u2019t. alan tudge: it is- it is absolutely true jon. there is a 99.8 per cent compliance with the geographical restrictions that we already have on the smaller number of visas for the regions today and we\u2019re significantly increasing the number of visas for the regions in the smaller cities to 23,000. now, that works in concert with bringing down the migration cap overall to 160 plus additional places specifically for the smaller cities in the regions. and in concert that does ease the pressure on a city like melbourne which has been growing enormously quickly. jon faine: because there are jobs. [audio skip] $15,000 scholarships to study in regional australia, is that- are you serious? $15,000 to 1000 students? $15 million injected to the rural economy through, what, handouts to students who go to regional universities? alan tudge: so there\u2019s two parts to this actually. so one of the significant components of our population increase has actually been international students. but again nearly all go to the big capitals when many of the smaller cities in the regions want more international students and they\u2019re great for a local economy. so we\u2019re doing two things - one thing we\u2019re providing an incentive in relation to your visa, you get additional work rights if you study in adelaide university rather than in say melbourne or in sydney. and second we\u2019re providing 1000 scholarships a year for both australian students and international students to study in a regional university or a smaller city university. the combination of the two supports those other things that we\u2019re talking about in terms of boosting up the regional areas and the smaller cities and just slightly easing the pressure on melbourne. jon faine: i\u2019m not sure how much of a gymnast scott morrison and his ministers including you- i\u2019m not sure how much of a gymnast you really are, but just in the last few weeks i\u2019ve just noted these back flips: today on immigration levels; on welfare reform you\u2019ve announced that you\u2019re having a rethink instead of beating up on unemployed people as you have for the last six years, you\u2019re going to try and help them find jobs. milo yiannopoulos can come to australia but now he can\u2019t; you\u2019re not going to give preference deals with one nation; mortgage brokers, well we\u2019re not going to wipe them out even though the royal commission said we should; and you\u2019re not going to introduce a facebook tax even though the rest of the world is. so that\u2019s quite a lot of flipping going on in the last 48 or so hours, isn\u2019t it? alan tudge: well that\u2019s a lot of assertions which you make in two or three sentences there as well. we\u2019ve never beaten up on welfare recipients, we\u2019ve always believed in mutual obligation though because ultimately the best form of welfare is a job and if people are looking for jobs and held accountable for looking for jobs and taking the jobs when they\u2019re available, then they\u2019re going to be better off as well as society. now we\u2019ve got the lowest welfare dependence in 30 years jon which is a combination of growing more jobs, because the economy\u2019s strong, as well as our mutual obligations system. and we\u2019re just adding some additional flexibility in that, which kelly o\u2019dwyer is announcing today. jon faine: additional flexibility? it\u2019s a complete change of attitude. alan tudge: no it\u2019s not. no it\u2019s not. we still have that core mutual obligation in place. jon faine: you\u2019ve been demonising the unemployed- you\u2019ve been demonising\u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] jon. jon. jon faine: \u2026them now for years. alan tudge: jon, come on. jon faine: and now there\u2019s an election coming you\u2019ve suddenly worked out\u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] no. no. jon faine: \u2026that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not a good look. alan tudge: no jon. we\u2019ve- we\u2019ve always required, and we\u2019ve strengthened this over time, that you must look for a job, that you must take a job when you\u2019re offered one, you must not just resign from work without another job being available and expect to go immediately onto welfare. and we\u2019ve strengthened those conditions. and what we\u2019re announcing today, particularly at around the job search is instead of having a fixed number of job searches which you must do each week, instead there\u2019ll be flexibility depending on the job market which you are in. jon faine: [talks over] so you\u2019ve been- alan tudge: if you\u2019re in a rural area \u2026 jon faine: you and i have had this argument for years. you were the minister responsible for a while and you would\u2026 alan tudge: [interrupts] that\u2019s how i know it- this is how i know it well jon. jon faine: but, but- and you would absolutely.. alan tudge: [interrupts] and i\u2019ve never beaten up on welfare recipients. jon faine: \u2026 you were absolutely insistent that there was nothing wrong with that policy when you were the minister. and now suddenly it\u2019s not a good one and you have to be more flexible. alan tudge: [talks over] that\u2019s not true \u2026 jon faine: why didn\u2019t you make the changes when the welfare sector were pointing out how much harm it was doing at the time? alan tudge: in- in fact- to the contrary, when i was the minister i was helping to strengthen the mutual obligation requirements to ensure \u2026 jon faine: [talks over] it was hurting people, minister, and you were being told and you ignored it. alan tudge: no. no, no. in fact i provided very clear data in relation to that. we strengthened the mutual obligations requirements and we actually also provided additional support for those very vulnerable people who were unable to complete their job searches or take a job for very reasonable reasons. and we made it very clear in relation to this. jon faine: okay can we- alan tudge: [interrupts] this still- no this still has the job search requirements but what it does recognise is that some markets have fewer jobs than others. if you\u2019re in a regional area there\u2019s no point putting in 20 applications into your small country town. jon faine: you just told us you\u2019re going to move more migrants to those regional areas? alan tudge: well it depends on which regions you\u2019re talking about. i mean\u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] and since when is adelaide, a city of what 1.5 million people, i mean calling it a small city? anyway can i- i want to flick the switch to something else. alan tudge: it is a- jon it is a smaller city. jon faine: it is smaller than some others, yeah. alan tudge: it is a smaller city compared to\u2026 jon faine: [talks over] can we? can\u2026 alan tudge: well it doesn\u2019t have the same congestion pressures that melbourne has. i mean everybody listening to this now knows the congestion pressures which melbourne has, it grew by 2.7 per cent last year when adelaide grew by\u2026 jon faine: [talks over] yeah because\u2026 alan tudge: \u2026 about 0.6 or 0.8 per cent per annum of the smaller base. jon faine: [talks over] because so much money\u2019s been spent on sydney\u2019s infrastructure and melbourne\u2019s been starved of federal funds\u2026 alan tudge: no it hasn\u2019t. no it hasn\u2019t. jon faine: \u2026and there\u2019s only so much the state government can give. but i actually want to pl- alan tudge: [talks over] 30 per cent of our federal funds over the next decade goes to victoria. jon faine: i actually want to flick the switch to something entirely different. can we have a conversation about progress? can we have a conversation about how in the last six years of tony abbott and then malcolm turnbull and now scott morrison who\u2019s been given the hospital pass \u2013 tell me where there\u2019s been progress in this country. alan tudge: well i think the main one is that we\u2019ve got unemployment down to 5 per cent, we\u2019ve got the lowest level of welfare dependency in 30 years. so if people have got a job they\u2019re well and truly onto the better path straight away. jon faine: whether we talk climate change; whether we talk social cohesion; whether we talk migration reform; whether we talk all the big issues; whether we talk about improving the health system; whether we talk about any of the big social or economic issues, has there been any progress for six years because i\u2019m struggling to see it and so are the listeners? alan tudge: let\u2019s go through that. so there\u2019s more job opportunities for everybody. there are lower taxes for everybody. we\u2019re putting records amounts of funding into infrastructure. we\u2019re putting records amounts of funding into schools and hospitals, as you mentioned. we\u2019ve got the budget now back under control and for the first time we\u2019ll have a budget surplus in many, many years. we\u2019ve got a strong aaa credit rating which means the economy is still going robustly, and [indisitnct]. jon faine: [talks over] okay, the budgets were under control and you inherited the credit rating. alan tudge: we obviously- we stopped- jon faine: [talks over] so now we\u2019ve got this ridiculous argument on free speech and hate speech. alan tudge: we got border- we\u2019ve got border protection- we\u2019ve got border protection back under control as well. we\u2019ve got very strong national security settings. we\u2019ve increased our defence budget because it was at anaemic levels when we first came to government. jon faine: so minister- alan tudge: i can continue to go on if you\u2019d like me to jon. jon faine: so regulating social media is suddenly something else that your government\u2019s woken up to. sky after dark, the murdoch tabloids, have been spewing out vile material including about so-called african gangs and demonising people who are seeking asylum because they\u2019re being persecuted in their own countries. and this has suddenly been discovered to actually have real world consequences. has this just dawned on you all? alan tudge: what the prime minister is leading in relation to the social media companies is, he\u2019s saying that this needs to be a global effort and so he\u2019s taking this to the g20 of which japan is the current president and saying that we need to work on this so that the social media companies will take more responsibility for when there is this vile activity\u2026 jon faine: [talks over] no. no. you\u2019ve got to do something about it. you\u2019ve got to do something about it tomorrow. you\u2019ve got to do something about it right now. alan tudge: yeah and we\u2019re- jon faine: people are getting hurt. alan tudge: i think you\u2019re right, people are getting hurt and i think the social media companies are being irresponsible in terms of letting, for example, the footage of the new zealand gunman, you know, play ad nauseam for a very long time live. jon faine: so okay then, on taxing the digital giants, at least try to get some regulation, some control. alan tudge: yeah so we in fact did introduce a new multinational tax avoidance package and i think we\u2019ve actually collected from memory \u2013 and you\u2019d have to correct me if i\u2019m wrong \u2013 something like $4 or $5 billion of extra revenue through those measures. cracking down on the multinational tax- multinational companies so they can\u2019t avoid tax for where they have activity. jon faine: well look we\u2019ve only just scratched the surface but it\u2019s been 15 minutes of fascinating arm wrestling. alan tudge, it\u2019s going to be an interesting election campaign when it finally gets underway and your seat, one of the most- well now one of the most scrutinised of government-held seats. we\u2019ll see where we get to. thank you for your time this morning. alan tudge: thanks very much jon. jon faine: alan tudge the federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population picking up where the prime minister on am this morning left off. "], "abc-adelaide-interview-ali-clarke-and-david-bevan": ["19 February 2019", "david bevan: alan tudge is the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, and he along with the prime minister \u2013 we all know that scott morrison does for a living \u2013 and the premier are going to make a big announcement this morning.  good morning to you, sir. alan tudge: good morning david. david bevan: it's about a half a billion dollar adelaide city deal. how much of this money is new and what are you going to do with all that money? alan tudge: listen, all $174 million of the federal contribution is new and the rest is the state contribution which goes into the lot fourteen site, and really it's in three areas that we're focusing on in this city deal. one being to create more jobs through innovation; two planning for population growth; and three boosting the visitor economy for a massive investment in cultural tourism. david bevan: okay. so what was the bit that caught your attention? when it came across your desk, you thought wow, i want to sit down and read some of this? alan tudge: [laughs] well i've been negotiating this deal with the premier over the last six months or so, so i\u2019ve very much been one of the architects here. i think together- it hangs together really nicely. it lays out a ten year plan across the three levels of government, and that's the real strength of the city deal concept is that it's all of us working together on the same agenda over a long period of time. i think the cultural economy stuff is really exciting, a brand new world-class indigenous art gallery right down near opposite the botanical gardens plus other investments in the art gallery and cultural spaces which is really going to drive further tourism to this state. ali clarke: minister tudge, you mentioned as part of the city deal an increase in work for people. with this amount of investment, how many jobs do you want to see or how many should we be expecting to see come out of this? alan tudge: oh, we haven't put a figure on that, but we fully expect this is going to really drive innovation and jobs growth here in adelaide and across south australia. it\u2019s centred around the lot fourteen site, the old hospital site and that's really going to be the premier destination for entrepreneurship, for technology, for commercialisation. of course, the space agency is going to be based there, along with other high tech companies as well. so it really is going to be driving new jobs growth here in adelaide. we're putting in money there as well into what we call an innovation hub. we're putting further investments to support the other activities which are going on there in lot fourteen. ali clarke: okay. then have you put a figure on the amount of increased revenue you will expect to see from tourism? alan tudge: oh, again, we haven't put that figure down yet. so what we are doing, though, is it's an $129 million dollars of extra money going into boosting tourism, if you like, through that investment in a world-class art gallery; through that investment in for example the construction of the [indistinct] gallery up at hahndorf; the new visitor centre at carrick hill house in springfield; in digital tools so that people can get around the place and understand; $30 million dollars for an international centre for tourism and hospitality and food studies. all of those things combined make adelaide an even more attractive destination than it already is. i mean, as everybody across australia knows \u2013 and i\u2019m from melbourne \u2013 adelaide is one of the cultural capitals of australia. you get something like 3.2 million visitors here every year and i think this will just provide an additional step change, increasing that. david bevan: all right. now, you're also promising money for a whole lot of road projects such as sorting out the cross road-fulton road intersection, port rush and mcgill roads get some money. there's some money for the daws road intersection. you know, we all hope that the party man is looked after. so that that's all happening and that adds up to close to $200 million dollars. alan tudge: yeah, that's right. david bevan: but minister, the really big project- the really big project that adelaide needs is a tunnel under south road and that's a few billion dollars. how advanced are your talks over that project? alan tudge: we\u2019re constantly having discussions with the south australian government in relation to this. so we've made massive investments already in the first stage of the north-south corridor and obviously the next major stage \u2013 that part that you\u2019re talking about \u2013 it is expensive and so we're having ongoing discussions. ali clarke: so with those ongoing discussions, our state government has given us three different options: either a tunnel or a part tunnel or even an overpass. or, you know, there are plenty. so what's your favourite if you've been having these ongoing discussions? alan tudge: at the end of the day the design work will be done by the state government because they'll have [indistinct] the design and the build. but we're in discussions with them constantly about what their future road priorities are, both now and in the years ahead. so- and obviously completing the north-south corridor is the key one that we're, you know, willing to step up to the table to support the south australian government on. david bevan: and there\u2019ll be an announcement, a commitment from your government before the election? alan tudge: sorry, in relation to the north-south corridor? david bevan: yeah, yeah. the big one. you're going to come out sometime in the next two months and say we've signed off on an agreement to invest a certain amount of money in that project. that\u2019s fair to say? alan tudge: do you know something that i don't? we- listen, when we\u2019ve got something to announce we will. we\u2019ve obviously got a budget coming up, there's an election coming up. we've already invested a huge amount into south australia as far as infrastructure dollars goes. we want to continue to invest further. we obviously know that the north-south corridor is a priority for the state government and for all residents across adelaide. and so yeah, we'll continue the discussions with the south australian government. ali clarke: in these discussions has globelink come up recently? the reason why i ask is because it is the marshall government's plan to remove road freight from the south-east freeway all the way through to portrush road. i mean, now it looks like you are spending money to upgrade the portrush road intersection but if globelink is still alive, are you going to be spending money that will be usurped? alan tudge: yeah, so globelink is another one of the very, very large scale projects. i'm aware of it. i know it's very early stages in terms the thinking of globelink at the moment. so we don't have any serious money invested into that, but i know it- it\u2019s there in terms of the medium- and longer-term project to do. david bevan: what\u2019s stephan knoll told you about globelink? \u00a0 alan tudge: oh, i've had some briefings in relation to it, but not for probably a couple of months and i haven't got my notes in front of me in terms of the details of that. but i know it is one of those large, expensive projects that will make a big difference to take the freight off of the major corridor throughout adelaide. so \u2026 david bevan: [talks over] minister, i reckon you and i will be driving flying cars by the time we get around to globelink. alan tudge: [laughs] so all these things you want to do but it's all about also having the right priorities at the right time and the amount of money to be able to these things. and obviously we're driving a stronger economy generally.  we're working hand in glove with the marshall government to support that. south australia is now really going well economically. and when you've got a stronger economy, of course you're able to invest in these types of things. you don't have a strong economy, you can't do these types of investments. ali clarke: all right. well minister alan tudge, thank you for your time. and only because you'll be dealing probably some other interviews in south australia it's hahndorf for us here not hahndorf. just so you know, \u2018cause you\u2019re from melbourne, you weren\u2019t supposed to know that. alan tudge: [laughs] my apologies. my apologies. ali clarke: no, that\u2019s alright. alan tudge: hahndorf, i\u2019m never going to forget that now. david bevan: hey look, we\u2019re happy to have strangers around here. we\u2019re not- so long as they bring money. ali clarke: thank you very much. alan tudge: well thank you very much for having me. ali clarke: that\u2019s minister alan tudge there.

for our rails which need significant investment; and for all the projects that need funding in our local electorates to make our areas even more liveable than they are now. south east queensland is an incredibly exciting place to live, but if you\u2019re driving to work each morning, many people are getting stuck in traffic by the time they get to the end of their street or when they get to the first intersection. all of my colleagues experience this. they are in touch with their communities, they\u2019ve been speaking with the prime minister, with the treasurer, with the finance minister over a long period of time and we are determined to add to the investment that we\u2019ve already been awarded in south east queensland. with the population growth, with the exciting developments in tourism in our south east corner, we need to have that significant investment so that we can grow with the population. we need to have the infrastructure and we can only do that as an lnp team, and we\u2019ve been able to work very closely together over a long period of time to arrive at this point today. i want to say thank you very much to graham quirk for his leadership of the mayoral group. he has really gone above and beyond working with his colleagues to put together this document. there\u2019s a lot within the document that will set up south east queensland for decades to come and scott morrison wants to be central to that plan. i know the prime minister has been really impacted by speaking to queenslanders during the number of visits that he\u2019s had to our state over recent months, learning about the difficulties that people have. as queenslanders, regularly we\u2019re stuck in roadworks because the investment hasn\u2019t been made in decades past. i want to make sure that all of us, like the prime minister, get the investment that we need in the south east corner. the prime minister, as we know, has already committed to significant investments in south east queensland, but through this document and through the work, the advocacy of the lnp colleagues behind me, we\u2019re going to continue to build on the investments that have already been made. so, happy to take some questions. if there are questions on other matters, i\u2019m doing a doorstop in the blue room, as you know, shortly with senator mckenzie and i might leave questions on matters related to the bills and what not until that point.  if there are any questions for alan tudge on the deal, then we might fire away. question: would the coalition government support financial [inaudible] for the cross river rail as part of the city deal? alan tudge: so, in relation to cross river rail, the state government has said that this is fully funded. so consequently, our $7 billion investment is being directed elsewhere. question: so there won\u2019t be any financial contribution as part of the city deal? alan tudge: well, it\u2019s fully funded. it\u2019s fully funded so any additional financial support that we put in is for the projects which aren\u2019t fully funded. peter dutton: i\u2019ll just add to that to that too; i mean we have put billions of additional dollars into the bruce highway and to the upgrade of the gateway motorway. in relation to the m1, bert van manen has worked hard, with lots of support from the people on the south side of brisbane, all the way to the gold coast. we have put billions of dollars into the m1, into road networks, off ramps, all the rest of it. the work that luke howarth has done. all of my colleagues. ted and andrew on the sunshine coast in relation to rail. all of this comes at enormous expense which labor hasn\u2019t provided any money for. there are projects that we\u2019ve got on the table at the moment, where the commonwealth has made a contribution, and the state is refusing to provide that money. we are not going to put money, we\u2019re not going to pull money out of the m1 and the bruce highway and the gateway upgrade to put it into labor projects. labor has said that those projects are fully funded and we are not going to take away from our investment that we\u2019re putting into those very significant investments to get people out of their cars, get them home more quickly with their families or off to work in the morning more quickly. question: will the deal come with any additional funding beyond the first [indistinct] dollars you have already promised? alan tudge: that\u2019ll be determined but every single city deal that we\u2019ve negotiated so far has ended up with significant financial contributions by the end of the deal we negotiated. as i mentioned, the townsville city deal had a $300 million contribution towards it. peter dutton: tudgey, sorry to interrupt, we\u2019re going to lose some of our colleagues that need to be in the chamber. so those that need to depart should depart\u2026 question: there\u2019s very little detail. - how can you say that [indistinct] in marginal queensland seats? alan tudge: well, this is the ninth deal that we have been undertaking since we\u2019ve come to government. city deals were something that we pioneered and we\u2019ve already got a number which are already signed. we\u2019ve got a number more which were about to sign and announce in the weeks ahead including hobart and adelaide. this will be the ninth one that we do and we\u2019ve been in discussions with the council of south east queensland mayors led by graham quirk for several months now. in fact, one of the first meetings which i had six months ago when i became the cities minister was with the council of south east queensland mayors, talking about how we can put a city deal together. but it is a big decision of the federal cabinet to enter into these discussions because it does involve internal resources immediately going towards it and it likely will involve a very significant financial contribution at the beginning. so, south east queensland is the third biggest population area in australia and one of the fastest growing. question: [inaudible question] alan tudge: listen, our work starts tomorrow and we hope to negotiate this as quickly as possible. but sometimes, these things can take months to actually come together working on exactly what your long-term plans are. but bear in mind that city deals aren\u2019t about tomorrow\u2019s initiatives; they are about outlining the 10 and 20-year horizon, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with the western sydney city deal, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with townsville, with darwin, with geelong, with the other city deals, with adelaide which we\u2019re about to announce, with hobart which we\u2019re about to announce \u2013 long-term plans to deal with the long-term population growth or other issues. this will inevitably be different to other city deals. everyone is different but the priorities, as they\u2019ve been articulated by the colleagues who stands behind me, by peter dutton, by other south east queensland members, from our perspective, it\u2019s got to be on infrastructure, be on jobs, and it\u2019ll be on [indistinct]. question: [inaudible] on when the election is called? alan tudge: you enter into good faith discussions and you try to complete things as quickly as possible but i can\u2019t tell you exactly when i think it will [indistinct] by. question: is there any update on when [indistinct] regional city deal? alan tudge: i haven\u2019t been leading that one \u2013 bridget mckenzie has, so you might direct the questions to her in relation to that. peter dutton: okay. alright. you can leave the other questions until later.

alan tudge: the northern suburbs- obviously there are a couple of big projects in north and northwest into the calder high- calder freeway and the hume freeway today. we were putting $100 million into a $50 million project\u2026 eil mitchell: [talks over] what about the doreen area? we\u2019re getting a lot of calls about doreen. alan tudge: we haven\u2019t- we\u2019re not announcing anything today in relation to doreen. i mean there\u2019s- the thing about melbourne- and i\u2019m from melbourne as you know neil i grew up in pakenham; i live in the other suburbs now in knox. and there are hotspots right across the city in part because our population is growing so fast and the infrastructure simply hasn\u2019t been keeping up. so today, we\u2019re actually about announcing a series of smaller projects to fix some of those local congestion hotspots. sometimes it can be a small local intersection which really causes people grief and that\u2019s on top of obviously the major billion-dollar investments that we\u2019re putting into the major highways and freeways. neil mitchell: well speaking of the big ones, is it right that you\u2019re still sitting on the $3 billion from east west link? alan tudge: yeah, we\u2019ve got three-billion-dollars which is there ready to go as soon as they come\u2026 neil mitchell: [talks over] oh, let\u2019s spend it, let\u2019s spend it. fix things. alan tudge: well [laughs], well, it\u2019s amazing you mentioned the east west link because i mean had we actually got on with the job\u2026 neil mitchell: [talks over] oh yeah, but that\u2019s gone. alan tudge: \u2026it would be finished by now. if it is, it\u2019s not going to be built\u2026 neil mitchell: [talks over] i agree with you; i agree with you but it\u2019s gone. alan tudge: \u2026it\u2019s not going to be built under daniel andrews but we need to take a look at that money and\u2026 neil mitchell: [talks over] well, but daniel andrews probably there for the next eight years, he\u2019s been to two elections and he\u2019s won both, arguably on- well the first one on this issue, it was certainly an issue with the second one, it\u2019s done. i don\u2019t agree with it either but the people have spoken, how can we get our hands on the $3 billion and spend it on the roads? neil mitchell: yeah, so we\u2019re going to be taking a look at that, neil, over the weeks and months ahead\u2026 neil mitchell: [talks over] what\u2019s [indistinct]? alan tudge: \u2026there\u2019s an urgent need in melbourne for more infrastructure which we\u2019re announcing a series of projects today and over the next couple of days. neil mitchell: yeah but that\u2019s a couple of a hundred million; we\u2019re talking about three billion here, we\u2019re talking about fair dinkum value. alan tudge: sure, sure. neil mitchell: when? alan tudge: absolutely but even over- even last year in our federal budget, we announced a further almost $8 billion for victorian roads. so there\u2019s fair dinkum money which is going into melbourne from the federal government and that\u2019s on top of obviously\u2026 neil mitchell: [talks over] okay. alan tudge: \u2026the lead guys who are the state guys who are largely responsible for building the infrastructure. neil mitchell: so you can\u2019t hold that there\u2019s any hope on the three billion in the near future? alan tudge: well just watch this space neil; in terms of we know that\u2019s an issue\u2026 neil mitchell: [talks over] well are you talking to the state government? alan tudge: we are disappointed that the andrews government doesn\u2019t want to build it and it needs to build\u2026 neil mitchell: are you talking to the state government about it? alan tudge: \u2026but we\u2019re taking a close look at it. neil mitchell: are you talking to the state government about it? alan tudge: well, we\u2019re taking a close look at it now. neil mitchell: what does that mean? are you talking to the state government? alan tudge: neil, in the weeks and months ahead, we\u2019ll be informing you. neil mitchell: at least sit down and talk to them. alan tudge: oh, listen, we have conversations with them all the time. neil mitchell: [talks over] they won\u2019t talk to me; they might talk to you. alan tudge: no, we have conversations with them all the time and even before we announced the calder freeway and hume freeway upgrades today, we had consulted with their officials and their priorities for them as well. neil mitchell: [talks over] good. but just ask you, you\u2019ve been\u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] i had conversations with the minister on a very regular basis. neil mitchell: you\u2019ve been looking at it for four years, i remember you introduce- getting, organising the meeting at a function- well, getting together joe hockey and tim pallas four years ago. alan tudge: and i\u2019ll tell you what neil, that if ever the state government decides to change their mind on what is a vitally needed piece of infrastructure, we will be there to support them... neil mitchell: [talks over] well they\u2019re not going to change anything. alan tudge: \u2026but your point is that they\u2019re not going to change their minds over the next four years and so consequently, we are looking other priorities. consequently, last year by the way, we put $5 billion on the table to finally get the airport rail built. neil mitchell:so what is the most- if you could wave a magic wand, what is the most important fix in victoria? alan tudge: there\u2019s a series of roads which need further development. one is that we need \u2013 and this is a rail project as i\u2019ve mentioned first \u2013 that is the tulla rail, it\u2019s been on the books for decades and we are now finally going to get it built. the monash constantly needs upgrades. we\u2019ve put further money into that. there are local hotspots though in individual communities which i know cause people enormous grief because sometimes it will take them 15 or 20 minutes just to get on to the major arterial, and we want to fix those little intersections and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about over the next few days. neil mitchell: thank you very much for your time. the urban infrastructure minister alan tudge.

[end of excerpt] mark braybrook: well, there's the prime minister speaking in brisbane today. alan tudge is the cities, urban infrastructure and population minister, who is basically in charge of implementing what the prime minister had to say today and joins me now.  minister, good afternoon. alan tudge: g'day, mark. mark braybrook: infrastructure\u2014getting home, getting around, trying to break the bottleneck. how important is it in this election year? alan tudge: oh, this is important generally, particularly in our big urban centres of south east queensland, melbourne, and sydney, where we do have considerable congestion. and what we're here to do is not only to announce the very large scale infrastructure projects which we've been doing over the last few years.   in fact, $20 billion worth\u2014but this week we're going to be announcing a number of smaller projects, just those localised pinch points which often can be real pains in the backside for people when they're trying to get home, and if we can fix those localised pinch points, sometimes with as little as $2 million or $3 million, you can really make a difference to people's lives, because they can save 10 minutes in traffic and get home earlier. mark braybrook: which is great, minister, but i'm sure a lot of the listeners now would be saying: why does it always happen in the lead up to an election? alan tudge: oh, well it hasn't been. i mean, we've been announcing infrastructure projects non stop since we've been in government\u2014in fact, over $20 billion worth for queensland alone. just in the last budget we announced $75 billion worth nationally. this week, we're going to be announcing $244 million worth of very localised projects\u2014and you heard a couple of those just mentioned by the prime minister then: the intersection of commercial road and doggett street in newstead, for example. just a small intersection, but we know that it's a real bottleneck and we want to fix that, we want to fix a number of those other localised bottlenecks which complement the major infrastructure\u2014highways and motorways and rail\u2014that we're putting in place. mark braybrook: one of those major projects is the cross river rail, which is very big here in south east queensland. will there be any money for that? alan tudge: there won't be, and that's because the queensland government has said that it's fully funded, and so therefore our focus has been elsewhere. if they're fully funding that, it enables us to be able to put money into other projects. we've got over a billion dollars, for example, into upgrading the m1, you know, such as the gateway merge on the m1 which people see being constructed right now; $300 million for the brisbane metro, the gold coast light rail, et cetera. we're getting on with these other projects and letting the state government build that, and they say that it's fully funded. mark braybrook: well, the premier would argue the reason they're doing that is because they're not getting any money from the federal government. who do we believe? alan tudge: [laughs] well, they've said for a long time that it's a fully funded project. now, you wouldn't expect us- i mean, if someone says that something's fully funded, then you don't expect them- somebody else to then put money in, because it's already catered for. so, we've got our focus elsewhere. mark braybrook: now, with regards to your portfolio\u2014cities, urban infrastructure and population\u2014it is one of the big issues in this country, in every city in the country, with regards to whether or not we have too many people living in our cities. how big an issue do you see it in the next five, 10, 15, 20 years to get it right? alan tudge: oh, i think this absolutely essential, and one of the real challenges we've got is we've got a lot of growth into those three major urban centres of south east queensland, sydney, and melbourne, and yet quite slow growth elsewhere in the country. so, part of our objective is actually to get a broader distribution of that growth. now, there's a number of things that we can do on that front, which we're working on. it's using migration as a lever, to see if we can encourage more migrants to settle in those regional centres or the smaller cities, rather than wanting to all come to melbourne, sydney or brisbane, for example. infrastructure's very important\u2014some of our economic development projects in those regional towns and the smaller cities are critically important as well. we do those sorts of things, then it does just slightly ease the pressure off the big capitals and supports the growth aspirations of some of those other areas at the same time. mark braybrook: minister, the government's handling of the economy is one of your strengths, but do you believe- do you think you're getting enough cut through with the voters, the fact that the economy is in better shape than people make out, and with the promise today from the prime minister that the debt will be cut over the next 10 years. do you believe you're getting the cut through for people to understand the state of the economy? alan tudge: well, i think we need to continue to talk about this right up until the election, because there is a lot at stake at the upcoming election, which will be in the middle of the year. and the economy has been growing strongly; we have created 1.2 million jobs.  we said we were going to create 1 million jobs. everybody said: no way can you do that. well, you know what? we have delivered 1.2 million, and the prime minister today is promising a further 1.25 million over the next five years. so there's very important commitment and we've got the track record to deliver. the contrary, by the way, is an opposition in bill shorten and the labor party who are promising $200 billion of new taxes on your investments, on small businesses, on your income, on your houses; you name it. and that has the effect of slowing down the economy and so you won't get that type of jobs growth if you start clobbering the economy, which labor is proposing to do. so there's a big decision at stake later in this year. mark braybrook: is the government the underdog? alan tudge: oh well look, polling would indicate that that's the case. i mean, the polling's narrowed a little bit but we never take any elections for granted. you always have to work hard to try to earn the respect of the people of australia. it's an absolute honour to be in government and i think we've done a very good job in terms of managing the economy and keeping people safe and ensuring that we've got things like the infrastructure and the health services in place. and therefore, we'll be asking the australian people to give us another go\u2014to continue that effort. mark braybrook: you mentioned the polls out today. has that given everyone a bit of a boost? the coalition up; labor down a bit. i know that it doesn't really matter when it comes to election day, but the way the polls have been in recent time\u2014has today's little rise given everyone a little bit of boost in the government? alan tudge: you'd always prefer to see the polls going in the upward direction for the government rather than the downward direction, but there's still a long way to go before the election and we're focused on what we've got to do and this week the very firm focus of the prime minister\u2014and i'll be supporting him up in queensland this week\u2014will be on this local infrastructure project, which often are very, very important things for the mums and dads trying to get home. mark braybrook: now minister, just finally, a number of your colleagues have announced they won't be recontesting the next election. a number of senior colleagues for various reasons; can the government afford to lose any more experience before the election? alan tudge: i think to be honest, mark, i mean this happens before every election where people have a think about whether or not they want to contest the subsequent election, and on both the coalition side and on the labor side we've had some senior people say that they're not going to contest. i mean, on the labor side you've had people like jenny macklin and wayne swan and kate ellis, michael danby; on our side a couple of people as well. and people do so, i think, for quite genuine reasons of wanting to spend more time at home with their families because their jobs can be pretty demanding in, in particular, western australia or more remote places like queensland is you're away from home a lot. mark braybrook: yeah, i understand all that, but from a sporting [indistinct], minister, you need that experience, don't you? you need people around you that have been there, done that and know how to handle the job. you know, to lose three key ministers in a week; you don't want to lose any more though do you? alan tudge: we've got a sensational team though, mark. it's headed by the prime minister, who's held many portfolios including the treasury, immigration, social services, before he become the prime minister. the treasurer himself has been in parliament for over eight years now and a very experienced person as well. right across the board we've got people who have been in parliament for 10, 20 years before holding ministerial portfolios. so that experience is there, but also when you do have a resignation it enables you to bring in new talent as well, and like in any organisation you're constantly trying to have an experienced team but also bring in new talent at the same time. mark braybrook: thanks very much for your time today and we look forward to tomorrow's announcement. alan tudge: thanks very much, mark.

alan tudge: so, this morning i was here with prime minister and the premier and we were announcing the fact that the space agency is going to be right here in adelaide and we're also signing the city deal memorandum of understanding, and what that deal will do is an agreement between the two levels of government for the development of the lot fourteen precinct, the old hospital site, as well- deb tribe: i was down there watching it being demolished a few months back. alan tudge: yes. right, right. so there\u2019s still some buildings which are coming down and it\u2019s going to be just a brilliant precinct in the near future and a real hub for innovation, which is what the vision is. and through that, it'll be a job creator; it\u2019ll be a place for training; and we just hope it'll be a real stimulator of the economy for south australia. deb tribe: quite unique to have a site of that size \u2026 alan tudge: exactly. deb tribe: \u2026 in the middle of a city \u2026 alan tudge: it really is. deb tribe: \u2026 and on what is already a cultural boulevard. alan tudge: it really is, with these beautiful buildings there which are being restored as well; and the space agency will be based there. there will also be a new museum put there, just right opposite the botanical gardens, and it\u2019s just a magnificent seven-hectare site. so, the vision of that is an innovation and entrepreneur precinct. i think it\u2019s fantastic. it\u2019ll end up being the best in the country when it's completed and a real stimulator for jobs of the future. deb tribe: how much of that site is going to be devoted specifically to the australian space agency? alan tudge: well, that's a good question. i don't know the answer to that. it\u2019ll just be one component of it. there\u2019s all number of other components, though, to the overall site. there's also going to be a new indigenous museum, art gallery built on the site as well, facing into the botanical gardens. so, it is going to be a magnificent site, which won't just be for the adelaide headquarters as such, adelaide cbd - it will really make a difference for the whole of the state because it will foster innovation, and at the end of the day, innovation drives jobs growth and drives the economy. deb tribe: well, look, we are going to return to space in just a few moments, with some of our space entrepreneurs already occupying sites in adelaide to find out their reaction to having the announcement this morning. i'm sure it will be very positive. alan tudge: it's such an exciting morning for adelaide in terms of announcing that space agency. it\u2019s a $41 million direct investment from the federal government into adelaide, but more importantly, it really places adelaide at the heart of space in australia. and it already has a significant industry here, but it means it\u2019ll turbocharge that industry and we hope that\u2019ll end up with thousands more jobs over the years ahead. deb tribe: well, look, i'd like to look at the issue of population now, if you wouldn't mind, minister, because i'm a big visitor to sydney and to melbourne. alan tudge: yeah. deb tribe: melbourne, i used to drive to often and found it really easy to navigate my way around. not so much anymore. very difficult to do so. alan tudge: that\u2019s exactly right. deb tribe: adelaide is a relatively easy city to live in with its current population. we- that's one of the things that people that live here are most happy about. how much bigger do you want us to become? alan tudge: the question is how you manage the growth. and i'm from melbourne and i know exactly what you're saying because 10 years ago the roads used to move in melbourne and now they\u2019re very congested, and people are telling us that loudly and clearly. and so- there's a lot of benefits to being a larger city like melbourne because you have more opportunities, particularly for young people. and so there\u2019s benefits of growing, but the question is how you manage that growth; and what we want to ensure is that as adelaide grows and as south australia grows, you have the infrastructure and the services and the housing approvals all aligned with that growth. and that's why we're bringing this concept to coag today, because we control the major population growth at the federal level, being the migration lever, but the states and territories are largely responsible for the infrastructure, the services, the housing approvals, and we have to make sure they\u2019re aligned, and that's what the discussion today is about. deb tribe: we have seen ad hoc developments occurring here in adelaide, certainly - i'm sure you\u2019ve had them in melbourne - where you'll have a parcel of land that becomes available; a developer decides to put housing on it but there isn't a forethought given to the roads in and out, to schools, to green spaces, all of the above. is it about trying to get some synergy between the three layers of government so that there are aims that they are all working towards? alan tudge: yeah. i think that's part of it. certainly, the most important thing at the macro level is for us to be able to match what are the major population levers, being migration\u2014and migration drives 60 per cent of the overall population growth\u2014with the states and territories\u2019 forward plans for infrastructure\u2014hospitals, schools, and property approvals, and we need to make sure they\u2019re aligned. and in sydney and melbourne, part of the difficulties which we've had there is that the infrastructure hasn't kept pace with the population growth. now, those cities have been growing very, very rapidly and we actually want to just ease the pressure off those big cities. but south australia, i mean, it has real opportunities to grow more and create more opportunities, particularly for young people so they don't feel as if they have to go over east in order to get further advancement in their career. deb tribe: if we just return to immigration for a moment, because that's a big issue for us here in south australia and decisions were taken about temporary visas, which had an impact on regional south australia. you\u2019ve been quoted as saying\u2014tell me if this is right or wrong\u2014that 87 per cent of skilled migrants go to sydney and melbourne. we've heard that that's not actually the case\u2014it's closer to 57 per cent. so, what do you see happening to south australia in terms of immigration and how are you going to try and ensure that people do come to adelaide and to south australia? alan tudge: yeah. so this is what we're discussing - and i've had these discussions with premier marshall about this - as to how south australia can, in essence, get its fair share. you've got to grow the economy to start with so that the job opportunities are here, and that's what things like the space agency are about; the shipbuilding investments; the defence investments and the like; and the economy is taking off in south australia. but second, then we want to support the growth aspirations with migration and- in a strategic, in a targeted way to support the jobs which are being created. we can do that. there\u2019s some levers at our disposal to be able to assist in that effort and we're going to be investigating those and working with the state government to implement it. deb tribe: okay. look, we've had a couple of calls in. and now, sam duluk, liberal member for waite, is on the line. good morning to you. sam duluk: good morning, deb. good morning, minister, and good morning to your listeners. deb tribe: now, you chair an inquiry into the benefits of migration to south australia. you've got the federal minister right here. what is it that you wanted to say? sam duluk: look - good morning, minister, and great to have you back in adelaide. and i think one of the important things that is coming through our inquiry that i'm chairing is one about appropriate planning, but it is about those federal levers around visas and priorities for south australia. and i think something that all the- everyone who\u2019s given evidence before our inquiry - all the ahas and the leading industry groups - want to see south australia have a special migration zone and status that can prioritise our needs for skilled migrants, and just keen to get our minister's view on that. alan tudge: so, the answer is yes, we do want to work on that, and even as a part of the city deal memorandum of understanding that the two leaders, the premier and prime minister, signed today\u2014part of it was about the development of lot fourteen as an entrepreneurial centre. the second element was actually about putting in place better settings to grow the population, which might include things like special visas for south australia or designated visas for particular areas where you need more people and have jobs which are available. we see this in a lot of regional areas, actually. in fact, the data shows that there\u2019s 46,000 job vacancies in the regions today in australia. sam duluk: and that's what our inquiry is finding as well. areas such as murray bridge... alan tudge: yep. sam duluk: \u2026 in the south east, through naracoorte, up port augusta and port pirie way, there's a need for a lot of skilled workers there at abattoirs and that type of thing. alan tudge: absolutely. i've been hearing that feedback as well from- particularly from the abattoirs, particularly from some of the farms who can't get workers to do the job. deb tribe: no, we know there\u2019s a need, but how are we going to get those workers here? alan tudge: yeah. so, we're working on that. in fact, one of the tools at our disposal, which we can implement and we're working on, is what's called a designated area of migration agreement, which is basically a boutique arrangement which you might make with a particular geographical area. we just did one in fact, signed it earlier this week, with western victoria, and they've got many of the same issues as parts of south australia have. so, there\u2019s a model there which we can utilise and we\u2019re keen to explore that. deb tribe: thank you very much for the call. look, if we can go to some of the texts that are coming through, and one issue that's being raised pretty much straight up is from dave: with rainfall dropping, with global warming and successive governments developing prime agricultural land\u2014forgive me, my screen has just refreshed\u2014haven\u2019t we already reached a sustainable population? alan tudge: i'm not sure what he means by the question in terms of a sustainable population. so is that person suggesting \u2026 deb tribe: [talks over] i think it means \u2026 alan tudge: \u2026 that we should not grow at all further? deb tribe: i'm assuming that that is what the question says. alan tudge: right. i mean, that's- a couple of things. a) we're going to grow because people are still having babies and people are still getting older, and that's a good thing on both counts. so you\u2019d have natural growth in any case, and that's about 40 per cent of the overall population growth. and second, though, migration is absolutely critical for australia, and it's critical in terms of filling skills shortages, which we don't have. it's critical, actually, in ensuring that we've always got a good working age population so that we don't age overall, because you very quickly find that if you're not immigrating younger people into the country, the overall population gets older and then economically that puts the country in a very poor place because you're obviously- you have fewer workers generating tax to pay for the services you need in old age. deb tribe: one of the big issues here in south australia is water of course. we're at the end of the murray-darling basin system. greg from north haven has called through on that issue. good morning, greg. caller greg: yes, good morning. thanks, minister. yeah, i think the previous questioner was asking about the provision of sustainable quality freshwater for current future generations in south australia and throughout the whole of australia. so, when i hear of an infrastructure australia sort of funding projects, it\u2019s often about roads, but in terms of quality freshwater for drinking and for agriculture et cetera\u2014plus in that context, the climate change with evaporation and salinity even for our underground aquifers\u2014we have some big issues to address here, minister. alan tudge: listen, in terms of the water challenges, absolutely, and that gets taken into account as well. so, what we've asked the premiers and the chief ministers to do is to inform us from the ground up, if you like, as to what the population plans are for their respective states and territories, taking into account all of the infrastructure that they have presently and have planned to be built into the future\u2014that might include water infrastructure. and then, as much as possible, we can set our migration settings based on the aggregate of those plans, and that way we can get a much closer alignment between what the carrying capacity is of the nation versus what our migration settings might be at the national level. deb tribe: there are obviously concerns in relation to population coming through on the text line. ray echoes what was said by greg in relation to water. steve says sydney and melbourne are vile, overcrowded, sprawling messes and are sobering examples of the end result of an economic system based on exponential growth - it disappeared again, let me find it - we need to think outside the square. we live in a finite space with finite resources. we can't grow, grow, grow forever. is there a limit? is there a limit\u2014you're looking at 11 million people in the next 30 years; at least 250,000 people here and additional in adelaide in that time, or dwellings at least\u2014is there a limit to sustainability? alan tudge: the question is how do you manage your growth and i think- deb tribe: [interrupts] but is there a limit? alan tudge: when you- you've got to look forward at least sort of 10 or 20 years into the future and that's what we want to do the forward planning for. and over the next 10 or 20 years, inevitably, australia is going to grow. it's going to grow on a natural basis, in any case, because people have babies, we\u2019re all getting older. deb tribe: [talks over] but is there a time that we should be worried, minister? is there a time that we say: actually, we are now encroaching into our arable land? we are now creating cities that are unliveable. we're going from the most liveable cities in the world to the most unliveable. is there a time- is that time going to come? alan tudge: well, we still have, i think, four out of the top 10 most liveable cities in the world. melbourne, sydney, adelaide's one of those, and perth and- so we're a long way from having the least liveable cities in the world. and as long as we plan our growth and we ensure that we've got the infrastructure; we've got the sustainability; we've got the water; we've got the schools; we've got the hospitals; we've got the housing approvals to match the growth, then i think we can get bigger, and there are real advantages also to growing as well. deb tribe: the planning is the issue. i'm getting- i can\u2019t read you \u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] that absolutely- deb tribe: \u2026 everything i'm getting on the text line here, but it's talking about, for example, one of the areas that we've got here in mount barker\u2014one of the fastest growing populations in australia\u2014very little thought put into it. and it comes back to the siloing, doesn't it, of decision making. we've got health. we've got transport. we've got all these different arms of government. we've got developers wanting to get- maximise their economic benefit from housing developments. how do you actually create a system whereby all of those things are put together to try and get the best outcome for the people living in the cities or living in the regional areas? alan tudge: yeah. i mean, i would say- deb tribe: [interrupts] what say do they have, actually? alan tudge: listen, i would say, overall in australia, we do pretty well with our cities. i mean, the fact that we've got four of the top 10 most liveable cities in the world, i think, is testament to that. but second, a lot of those very localised planning decisions are obviously not made by the federal government and we don't necessarily want the federal government intruding down at that very localised level\u2014that has to be done by local councils and the state governments. where the federal government needs to be involved, though\u2014which is what we've been discussing and what's on the coag agenda today\u2014is in relation to the population growth rates for each of those particular regions and what actually is manageable, because we, at the federal level, control the main lever - and that is migration as i was indicating before - and how do we ensure that we've got the right population growth in the right parts of australia. can we ease the pressure slightly off melbourne and sydney? can we grow in a strategic manner, south australia, which is the aspiration certainly of the south australian government? and- but you've got to have the planning in order to be able to cope with that. deb tribe: do you believe in climate change? that\u2019s a question on the text line. alan tudge: is that a question on the text line? the climate, of course, is changing, and human beings are making a contribution towards that. deb tribe: well, minister, i don't know what time you have to leave, whether you can stay with us or not. are you on a very tight time schedule to get to the airport? alan tudge: [talks over] i can keep going if you\u2019ve got a few more questions. deb tribe: okay. it's 23 minutes past nine. with me is alan tudge, federal member for aston and minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population. in just a moment, we\u2019re going to get the response from michael bayliss, communications manager of sustainable population australia. deb tribe: in the studio with me this morning is the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, alan tudge. in just a moment, we'll hear from sustainable population australia, but martin from clarendon has called in on 1300-222-891. good morning, martin. caller martin: oh, hello. look, my concern is that migrants get old too, and then do we bring in more migrants? when does the ponzi scheme end? this sounds very much to me like a pr piece for the growth lobbies who donate very, very heavily to political parties. my concern is that we're going to keep growing and one day, we\u2019ll wake up and say: good god, we've wrecked the place. deb tribe: thanks very much for the call, martin. i have to say that's being echoed on the text line, minister. for example, deb from warradale has just sent in a text, saying today's infill in suburbs, tomorrow's slums\u2014no backyard, no trees, no gardens, street trees cut down. my suburb is becoming a nightmare at the hands of developers building boxes. do the people of adelaide really want it to become another sydney or melbourne? so, how are you going to overcome that fact? i mean, people are raising legitimate issues. alan tudge: yeah, sure. so, in terms of appropriate developments, i mean, those are decisions for your local councils and for state governments, and you want to make sure you have good local planning and you need to be involved in your local council elections and get involved in that process \u2026 deb tribe: [talks over] but what- alan tudge: \u2026 to ensure that you get that. deb tribe: what are you asking the ministers at coag to do today? because doesn't there have to be a complete cooperation and synchronisation between the three tiers of government? alan tudge: well, that's exactly why we have put it on the coag agenda as the number one item for discussion today. and as i said, we don't want to get involved in the sort of the microplanning. the federal government doesn't want to be involved in determining what sort of housing developments you have in a particular suburb, but we do control the population growth lever, which is the migration growth lever. deb tribe: but has anybody asked australians what they want? alan tudge: we\u2019re having a pretty rigorous discussion at the moment in relation to migration, in relation to population, in relation to planning. this discussion \u2026 deb tribe: [talks over] i mean more about- alan tudge: \u2026 is going on around australia at the moment. it always becomes an election issue as well, so it's inevitably discussed as part of election cycles. now \u2026 deb tribe: but who- alan tudge: \u2026 in terms of- i want to take it up this comment. this point to the person- deb tribe: [talks over] who decides, though, what makes a place a good place to live though? who makes that decision? alan tudge: well, these are- deb tribe: what evidence-based research is there on that? alan tudge: i mean, these- we live in a democracy here and we've got three levels of government, all of whom are accountable at election time. and we have a role at the federal level and we're placing population planning more squarely on the federal agenda. obviously, the state governments have a role, as do local councils, and so the people get a say at all three levels of governments in relation to these things. sometimes you have political parties who are running, particularly on a: slowdown australian growth or more public transport or no inappropriate development. i've seen political parties particularly on those matters. i just want to pick up, though, and i- it was put and it wasn\u2019t answered. the caller before was just saying: oh, we're just all part of the growth lobby. we've got money in our pockets. i mean, i find that offensive, to be honest, and particularly when the prime minister himself has actually said that the likely outcome of this process will be a slowdown in growth. so, let's be clear about that. it will likely be a slowdown in the migration intake as a result of this process. deb tribe: okay. well, minister, we're getting an urgent hand waving from your colleague. you've got to get on a plane and get out of here, but thank you so much for coming to the studio this morning. greatly appreciated. alan tudge: a pleasure, deb. thanks. deb tribe: thank you. the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population alan tudge, joining us in the studio. "], "radio-national-breakfast-hamish-macdonald": ["12 December 2018", "hamish macdonald: scott morrison\u2019s push to cut immigration will face stiff resistance from the labor states when he hosts coag talks with the premiers in adelaide this morning. population policy will be the number one issue on a packed coag agenda which will also include health and education funding. last month, the prime minister flagged a reduction of around 30,000 immigrants to take the pressure off our overcrowded bigger cities and he wanted to give the states a bigger say on how to balance population pressures. alan tudge is the minister for cities and population and as scott morrison puts it, he is the minister for congestion busting. i spoke with him a short time ago. [excerpt] alan tudge: good morning, hamish. hamish macdonald: the labor states, at this point, appear that they won\u2019t play ball on this. they say that the focus should be on infrastructure spending not the migration intake itself. doesn\u2019t that mean that this approach that your pushing of bottom-up to manage population growth, will fail at the first hurdle? alan tudge: to the contrary, i\u2019ve had very good discussions with many of the state leaders, chief ministers in northern territory for example. they want stronger population growth and they want the infrastructure to match it. and that\u2019s what this approach is, it is looking at the situation city by city, state by state to say: what is your carrying capacity now and into the future and how can we support the population growth to meet that carrying capacity. hamish macdonald: so our population in august this year topped 25 million, that is 33 years ahead of schedule. by 2047, it\u2019s expected to grow by another 11 million people and 80 per cent of that growth is expected to be in the biggest capital cities: sydney, melbourne, brisbane, perth and adelaide. are you saying that as a result of this process, we won\u2019t see that growth or that growth will occur elsewhere? alan tudge: well we certainly want to see a better distribution of the growth. certainly, 75 per cent of the growth over the last few years has been into melbourne, sydney and southeast queensland. whereas a place like adelaide and the premier marshall there, have been open about saying they want to grow faster. so there\u2019s an opportunity here to slightly ease the pressure on places like melbourne or sydney which are really feeling the congestion pressure and to support the aspirations of places like adelaide and darwin and perth and hobart, which all do want to grow slightly faster. we\u2019ve also got the regions as well which many places are crying out for more workers. they simply can\u2019t get a warm body to do the job. hamish macdonald: can we be specific though, about the numbers? because if we\u2019re talking about 80 per cent of that growth coming in those bigger cities, are you saying that you don\u2019t want that to be the case? alan tudge: no. we\u2019re saying that what we\u2019d want to do is see a better match between what the population growth is and what the carrying capacity is of those cities. so that you don\u2019t have runaway population growth without the infrastructure being developed at the same time. and in melbourne and sydney, i think there\u2019s been a bit of a mismatch and people are really feeling it because the roads are congested, some of the housing levels haven\u2019t been keeping up with population growth. so how can we better align that city by city and region by region? now, what that might mean is that we slightly ease the pressure off sydney and melbourne and say, support the faster growth in some of the other places in australia. hamish macdonald: so given what you have just said, isn\u2019t the issue of commonwealth spending on services and infrastructure key? i mean victoria, for example, has 25 per cent of the population but just 10 per cent of the infrastructure spend. if you\u2019re saying you want a better match, a better distribution, isn\u2019t commonwealth spending actually the key matter here? alan tudge: we\u2019ve got record infrastructure spending, $75 billion over the next 10 years. and for victoria, which is my home state, they\u2019re getting 30 per cent of that $75 billion because it is fast growing state. and melbourne is certainly the fastest growing city in australia. but you\u2019ve just got to understand that at the federal level, we largely control the population growth levers through the migration intake, whereas the states and territories largely have the responsibility for developing the infrastructure, the housing approvals, the schools and the hospitals et cetera. what we need to do is to better align those two things because that\u2019s when you can get better managed, controlled population growth where the infrastructure and the services are keeping up. and that\u2019s what this approach is about, a bottom-up approach that we\u2019re asking states and territories to tell us what us their carrying capacity in their cities both now and in the future and how can we match population growth to support that carrying capacity. hamish macdonald: so minister, if we take victoria as the example, in order to do that, you\u2019re either going to have to reduce the growth of the population or increase the amount of infrastructure spend, don\u2019t you? alan tudge: [talks over] we\u2019re\u2026 hamish macdonald: i don\u2019t really understand how you achieve the objective that you\u2019re describing without one of those two things? alan tudge: well, we are asking every state and territory leader to come forward by the end of january to tell us what are their population plans in their states. they\u2019re the ones who are responsible for the infrastructure build for the schools, the hospitals, the housing approvals. and then let\u2019s try to match the population growth to that. hamish macdonald: so unless you are willing to give them more money, they would have to reduce their population growth projections? alan tudge: well in fact, most of the leaders, i think, will be putting forward proposals to grow their populations faster than what they presently are. that\u2019s what i would expect certainly from a south australian premier, he said that openly. that\u2019s what i\u2019d expect from the chief minister of the northern territories. possibly the same from western australia and tasmania. so we\u2019ll see what comes out of victoria and new south wales in terms of what they say. hamish macdonald: the parliamentary budget office figures seem to indicate that federal infrastructure spending is actually going to fall over the next four years from eight billion in 2017 to 2018 to 4.5 billion in 2021 to 2022. that paints a pretty clear picture of the direction of travel of this whole process, doesn\u2019t it? if there\u2019s going to be less money for infrastructure spending from the commonwealth, if the states are not able to produce that sort of money themselves, then we\u2019re really just talking about declining growth rates in terms of population, aren\u2019t we? alan tudge: the states are primarily responsible for building infrastructure in their [indistinct] regions. but the federal government is a very significant financial contribution towards that and we have put a record amount of infrastructure dollars provided to the states and territories to contribute to that. seventy-five billion dollars over a ten-year pipeline and that will continually\u2026 hamish macdonald: [talks over] but do you accept that the numbers are going down in the coming years though? alan tudge: and that will continually be looked at each and every year in the budget context. but certainly, this year\u2019s budget was a record amount of infrastructure expenditure\u2026 hamish macdonald: [interrupts] but can we just be honest about the funding that is available. is it going up or is it going down over the coming years? i mean, you want to be elected as the federal government again, i presume next year. let\u2019s be honest about whether the money is going up or down. alan tudge: well there\u2019s record amounts of infrastructure investment right now. that\u2019s what i can say. that\u2019s what we announced in this year\u2019s budget. a record amount over a period of time. hamish macdonald: [interrupts] can you acknowledge the projections or not? as i understand that grants will half over the forward estimates from 0.4 of a per cent of the gdp to 0.2 per cent of the gdp. alan tudge: [talks over] no, i don\u2019t acknowledge that. hamish macdonald: [talks over] why? alan tudge: i acknowledge that we\u2019ve got record investments in infrastructure over the next decade. and each and every budget, we update what the infrastructure expenditure looks like. and so this is very typical of the budget process but certainly we\u2019ve never invested more money from the federal level into infrastructure right across the country. hamish macdonald: i take it though that you don\u2019t dispute the figures put forward by the parliamentary budget office? alan tudge: no. but just the way the infrastructure dollars are spent, hamish, is that every single budget, you go through a process and we outlined a massive budget commitment in the budget this year over the next 10 years. inevitably, these get updated and examined each and every year as we go forward as well. hamish macdonald: the new south wales premier gladys berejiklian appears to be the only state leader who supports cutting immigration in their actual state. she's come up with a plan to give international students incentives to leave sydney, for example, to study elsewhere in the state. we don\u2019t know if the incentives will be financial or related to visas. can you just explain for us, how something like that would work? obviously, if people are becoming citizens of this country, we don\u2019t necessarily control- we can\u2019t control where they are based, if visas are attached, perhaps that\u2019s possible. is there are a role for the commonwealth in a process like this, where you\u2019re getting people that come to australia to go to a particular place? alan tudge: certainly, we\u2019re taking a look at that and this is one of the ways that we can support the growth aspirations of some of the regions or the smaller cities and take a bit of pressure off the big capitals is by creating further incentives for the new migrants to choose those smaller cities or regional areas. and you can create incentives through the visa process and you can put conditions upon those visas for people to stay in those areas for a few years. the evidence suggests that when we do that, we already do that at a small level, people abide by their conditions and indeed do stay there for many years even after their conditions have expired. hamish macdonald: alan tudge, i know you\u2019ve got a flight to catch. we will leave it there. thank you very much. alan tudge: thanks very much, hamish. hamish macdonald: alan tudge is the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population.

where\u2019s the liberal party on women? you\u2019ve copped a bit of flack in recent days. alan tudge: i think what most people are concerned about is that our policies are direct towards supporting women and we certainly have very strong policies there, particularly providing women choices to whether or not they want to work, childcare policies and the like. i was particularly vocal today though because the labor party wanted to suspend standing orders i.e. interrupt the debate in order to put forward this motion, when in fact the next item for discussion was about domestic violence. and i thought that was a more important bill to be debating and to pass rather than going through what ended up really being a stunt by the labor party. peta credlin: the other issue that\u2019s derailing the government today, i mean, i think you got through the women\u2019s issues last week, you dealt with the defection of julia banks one of your victorian colleagues. but of course, malcolm turnbull entered the fray last night and again today. he went very hard, he says\u2014the government should go to the polls before the new south wales election scheduled for the 23rd alan tudge: former prime ministers are entitled to their views, but we are absolutely focussed on the policies which matter to the australian people, rather than getting distracted by any commentary about when an election might be or any of our internal machinations. the australian public reward us when we deliver for them on the issues that matter. it is the economic growth, it\u2019s the national security, its building infrastructure, it\u2019s doing things like that which are important to everyday australians. if we start talking about ourselves every single day, i think that they rightly punish us for it. peta credlin: on one of the areas that i think you listened as a government recently, was a decision by the prime minister where he announced that australia would not sign this global compact on migration set for discussion in morocco in about eight days\u2019 time. now, this is something australia under julie bishop as foreign minister was a co-author of. so for about the last 12 months australia had been at the table and nutting out a document that when you looked at its final draft form, put at risk things like our ability to prosecute a policy of detention centres as a last resort on keeping control of sovereign borders. now a lot of your colleagues, the more they knew about it were up in arms. your supporters certainly didn\u2019t like it. why did you not sign it in the end because that\u2019s a big move? alan tudge: well in the end, the most important thing was that we maintained our own sovereignty over our borders and my understanding was that there was concerns by prime minister morrison and by peter dutton that we would lose some sovereignty if we did sign it. now, we've got a very good track record in relation to border protection. we stopped the boats once again. we've got 2000 children out of detention, we've closed down 17 detention centres overall and we must maintain that strong border protection regime so that the people smugglers business can't start again. that was the primary reason why we didn't sign that agreement so that we can be in control of our own destiny. peta credlin: yeah. but it's a close run thing; it wasn't that australia [indistinct] slipped under the radar to somebody. it's only the issue now that a change of prime minister has killed off this agreement for australia to sign. there are now many other nations around the world who have also walked away from this global compact. but as i said, under the former foreign minister, under the former prime minister, you were at the table. now, i don't know how much of this is debated internally, but why on earth was australia part of this in the first place? alan tudge: peta, i don't know the answer to that question in terms of how advanced the proposals were. now, sometimes as you know though, we will be at the international table so that we can have a shaping of what an agreement might look like and if the agreement ends up being a good one for australia and in our national interests, we\u2019ll then sign it. but other times you can be at the table, try to shape an agreement and it ends up not being in our interests and that may well have been the case here. at the end of the day we didn't sign it, we maintain our absolute sovereignty over our borders and that's how it should be. peta credlin: okay we're talking about plans and agreements and deals; will the coalition have a population policy\u2014an actual document with a number inside it as a target population or a cap- best expressed a cap, ahead of the next election, will you actually have a policy? alan tudge: we are developing our policy as we speak peta and we will have a policy which is well articulated before the next election and a couple of things which that policy is going to do. most importantly though, it's going to better align what our population growth is with what the infrastructure and service delivery is on the ground because this is part of the problems that we've had particularly in our larger capitals, is that whereas we control the population levers\u2014the growth levers, the states and territories are largely responsible for on the ground services and infrastructure. and we need a better alignment of those two things so that you don't get the build up of congestion, so that roads are built in line with population growth rather than behind it, so the schools and hospitals are being built concurrently. that's almost going to be the most important thing which comes out of it. now, we've asked the states and territories to let us know what they're carrying capacity is and we're going to build the population or the migration settings bottom up, if you like, through that process rather than what we've typically done is a much more top down approach. and i think through that process we will get that better alignment. it may well end up in a slowdown overall in population through a reduction in the migration intake, but we certainly will have a population policy well before the next election. peta credlin: so when is the material coming in from the states and territories, what\u2019s the deadline there? alan tudge: yeah, so that's going to be by the end of january. so the states and territories have been written to by the prime minister, effectively asking them\u2014what's your carrying capacity of your city, in your state today and into the future? what do your forecasts and plans look like in terms of infrastructure, hospitals, schools and the like and therefore, how many people do you need for those or for your state or for your capital city? and then we will incorporate that as we set our migration settings because migration\u2026 peta credlin: [interrupts] okay minister, i\u2019m just going to jump in there. alan tudge: \u2026is 60 per cent of the population growth rate. peta credlin: let me just jump in there. so if, for example, for round figures we're talking about 100,000 people coming to australia once you get the views of all the states, you'll get a case say out of new south wales saying no more. you might get a case out of south australia saying\u2014well we can carry another 20 or 30,000 in an ideal world. you set your national target for 100,000, how do you ensure the distribution of people once they get through sydney airport or melbourne airport or brisbane airport that the distribution matches the forecasts that the states gave you? that there is none that goes to new south wales, that there is the 30,000 that end up in south australia? how do you make that happen? alan tudge: so, i would be firstly very surprised if the new south wales government came back and said they don\u2019t want any migration into new south wales. i mean, i think that would have very serious consequences for the overall economy of new south wales. for some service provision, you think about aged care, it\u2019s so reliant upon new migrants delivering those services. what i do expect is that most of the smaller states, though, will be asking for more people. and so, we\u2019re going to aggregate those here. peta credlin: [interrupts] yeah, but i\u2019m not asking you about that, minister. i\u2019m asking you how on earth\u2014how do you, as the federal minister, make sure there is a match between what the states want or don\u2019t want in terms of migration? how do you ensure the distribution meets requirements? alan tudge: listen, in some respects, we already do a little bit of this. so, it\u2019s not a new concept. and that is that you can create incentives for new migrants when they come into the country to go to certain areas. and then you can place conditions upon their visas to stay in that area for at least a few years. and in that time, you hope that they put down roots, their kids go to school, and they make it their home. and we can do that at a much more aggregated level to what we have done in the past, but the tools are already there. i should also point out that a large part of our migration intake is actually\u2014it\u2019s demands driven, if you like, i.e. it\u2019s employer sponsored or it\u2019s family reunions [audio error] smaller cities in any case, and that will still be a significant part of the overall migration program. peta credlin: so, will we see an actual document that details the splits per state? will we see the mechanism, whether it\u2019s a visa class particular mechanism or other, that you will employ to ensure that this distribution occurs? and will we see this outside and before an election campaign, or is it something we\u2019re going to have to wait until the 33 days in may? alan tudge: no, you will see the mechanisms which we are able to deploy in order to encourage people to go to certain states or to cities and to stay there. you will also what the overall migration level is going to be. now, that cap is set on an annual basis, but we\u2019ll be able to also put out some better forecasts as well. now, all of these things which we\u2019ve articulated at a higher level, we\u2019re working closely with the states on and developing the further detail, which we\u2019ll be able to release and announce early next year, well before the election. peta credlin: okay. on another related matter to the fortunes of the government going into what we know now will be a budget in april, an election in may\u2014a federal election, at least. how does the victorian liberal party\u2014you\u2019re a very senior member now- how does the victorian liberal party rebuild? alan tudge: oh, we\u2019ve got a bit of soul searching to do just in terms of what happened at the state election. and we\u2019ve lost some very good members of parliament there. and we need to ensure that we have a new president who can be a uniting force for us. and i think the members of parliament have a responsibility to come together and work together coherently and bring the party together over the next six months, certainly, but in the years ahead as well. now, this is\u2014it\u2019s always a difficult time for a party after you\u2019ve had a significant defeat in your state. and we\u2019re addressing that; we\u2019ll have a review of that election campaign. but then\u2014we will rebuild. and we\u2019ve done so in the past, we will do so again because ultimately, i think, australians want the type of policies and values which the liberal party represents. and that is\u2014they want economic growth, they want strong national security, they do want individual responsibility to be infused throughout it. they do want us to support the family and to support small businesses and ultimately, those are the core principles upon which our party is built and which we\u2019ll continue to build from. peta credlin: alan tudge, before you came into parliament, you worked very closely with noel pearson in cape york creating, architect wise, the new family responsibilities commission, as it was then and it gave elders the autonomy, the authority to deal with issues in their community, to basically kick parents into gear if kids weren\u2019t going into schools, to deliver some sort of indigenous based community justice. these centres have now been going for a decade\u2014you correct me if i\u2019m wrong\u2014hugely successful, turned around the fortunes of crime in these communities, truancy, and other things that really matter in indigenous communities. unfortunately, the palaszczuk government has pulled up stumps and will not fund them. what\u2019s gone on? why is this such a big issue? alan tudge: you\u2019re right, peta. and i was involved in the design of this before i became a member of parliament a decade ago, working very closely with noel pearson\u2014i was his deputy director. and what it did is set up a state statutory authority which empowered local elders, so that when a family wasn\u2019t sending their kids to school or misbehaving and getting to trouble with the police, that family had to go and front up to the local elders. and through that statutory authority, the elders were empowered to make quite substantial decisions over those individual members of the community. now, it\u2019s worked well. the principle is right about empowering the responsible elders and i was hoping that that would be spread further abroad. but, the queensland government\u2019s pulled the pin; it\u2019s cancelled that family responsibilities commission. and i think it\u2019s a very disappointing outcome, because it\u2019s a model which could\u2019ve been used further afield, indeed, around the country, rather than destroyed as has been occurred in this instance. peta credlin: alan tudge, thank you for your time. if i don\u2019t get a chance to speak to you before christmas, have a very merry christmas. alan tudge: thanks very much, peta. you too.

what are you going to talk to, and are you offering any money? alan tudge: [laughs] i\u2019m here to discuss largely two topics today. that is population policy and also cities policy. so i\u2019ve got a series of meetings to discuss those two topics and i\u2019ll be meeting up with the premier later on today as well to discuss the shape of what might be an adelaide city deal. leon byner: alright, now the other point is: scott morrison's announced that we're going to cut from 190 to 160 the immigration numbers per se, but again we need people. the problem is you can bring them in but unless you leg brace them they'll leave pretty quickly because as lovely as adelaide is, there is a perception amongst those younger people with families and so on, and others, that opportunity exists elsewhere. that is going to have to be part of your conversation, isn\u2019t it? alan tudge: yeah, yeah no, that is part of the conversation. it is interesting leon, as you raise, in melbourne and sydney\u2014and i'm from melbourne\u2014we're really feeling the pressure because nearly all the population growth in the country is to those two big capitals and brisbane as well. whereas there\u2019s places like here in adelaide which many people are actually seeking to grow this city and grow this state and indeed the premier marshall does want to do that. now, our population plan is going to accommodate that. it will ease the pressure on those big cities but it will enable a place like south australia to grow more rapidly to sustain [indistinct]. leon byner: [talks over] you can ask migrants to come here. you can invite them here and you might have an agreement that they have to be here. but if there is not the job opportunity, like might exist interstate, what do you expect them to do? what do you expect them to do? alan tudge: yeah, a couple points on this. one is that (a) there are job opportunities and as you know the unemployment rate here in this in this state is coming down. in the regions today, leon, there are 47,000 job vacancies today and that has been growing by 9 per cent per annum. leon byner: now why can't we fill those? alan tudge: for all number of reasons. some places, simply the local population is not big enough to cater for the job requirements. in other cases the australians who are sitting there on welfare don't want to step up and take or don't have the skills to be able to take those jobs. but the point i'm saying is that there jobs out there. here in south australia, across regional australia, in other parts of the country. they\u2019re not just in melbourne and sydney and brisbane. and we want to work on plans to encourage more migrants to come here. we can create incentives\u2026 leon byner: but we already encourage them though. alan tudge: we do in a modest way and so we're looking at opportunities where we can provide further incentives for migrants if they choose to take advantage of these incentives and go\u2026 leon byner: what incentive would that be? alan tudge: \u2026and go into places like south australia or to western australia or [indistinct]\u2026 leon byner: [talks over] what would be the incentives you\u2019re offering? alan tudge: well for example at the moment if you come in through the\u2026what\u2019s called the general skilled migration scheme. it\u2019s when you accumulate points and if you get enough points you get invited into the country, right, you get points for speaking english, for having a university degree, all that sort of stuff. we could offer additional points for choosing to go to south australia. now we already\u2026 leon byner: [interrupts] okay, well they get points, now what will that mean? alan tudge: and so then you get additional points and that means you\u2019re higher up the priority list and that means you\u2019re more likely to get the spot in australia. bear in mind there\u2019s always millions of people that want to come into this country and that means\u2026 leon byner: once you\u2019re here though\u2026 alan tudge: \u2026that they\u2019ll come into south australia rather than necessarily melbourne or sydney. leon byner: once you\u2019re here though you stay for a bit, you get the lay of the land.. alan tudge: sure. leon byner: can i suggest you talk to the centre of economic studies, michael o'neal or darryl gobbett because the unemployment rate is going down. that\u2019s because there are less people looking because the kinds of jobs- see we need, we desperately need more taxpayers here to pay for those people who are getting on in years who are going to need help. and there's an ever diminishing number of people to pay taxes to have us afford this. so you've got a few issues there\u2026 alan tudge:\u00a0 that\u2019s exactly right. this is going to be part of our population policy as well. there's one thing is around how we manage the growth and how we get a better distribution of population growth to take the pressure off the big cities and put support here\u2026 leon byner: are you putting any money up? alan tudge:\u00a0 and the second thing- and just let me finish this. the second thing is we have to be acutely concerned with that issue that you\u2019re talking about that we don't age as a population overall which means\u2026 leon byner: well we are. alan tudge: \u2026we\u2019ve got fewer taxpayers in order to support people into retirement. leon byner: we haven\u2019t. that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. alan tudge: it has what\u2019s called the dependency ratio has declined. there's fewer working people now for the aged population and we've got to manage that and migration has been a very good mechanism to manage that because the average age of a migrant that comes into the country is 26 years. leon byner: well you had a second term in parliament to do all this. have you not done that? alan tudge: listen, we have in relation to that particular issue. so the average- in fact we've brought down the average age of migrants coming in. it used to be that you couldn't get- you have to be under 45 now for the skilled migration scheme. it use to be you had to be under 50. so we've already brought that down and we've put more emphasis on that skilled migration stream. leon byner: but that\u2019s a modest change though in the scheme of what we're talking about. jobs for people here who do not have to move by necessity. alan tudge: and we've discussed this before in terms of the welfare system. we have absolutely tightened the welfare system to the extent, leon, and this is actually i think one of the great achievements of our government and that is we've got now the lowest proportion of people on welfare, working age people on welfare in 25 years and we've had\u2026 leon byner: [interrupts] that\u2019s because the population has gone up. alan tudge: no no this is lowest proportion of people on welfare of the working age population in 25 years. [indistinct]\u2026 leon byner: [talks over] now look, can i put this another way\u2026 alan tudge: we\u2019ve done remarkably well on this. no, that\u2019s because of job creation. a million jobs being created and also the crackdown on welfare as well. leon byner: i have a song i play when we get the economic indices and it's this. [can you feel it] now, i\u2019m sure your statistics are accurate. you know what the problem is? the people listening say, but alan, i\u2019m not feeling it. you get that don't you? you know what i mean by that don\u2019t you? so why? alan tudge: i think one of the challenges that we've had has been that the wages growth hasn't been as fast as we'd ideally like it to be. leon byner: it\u2019s been merely flat. alan tudge: we\u2019ve seen an uptick actually in recent times and that's great to see. we want to see greater wages growth\u2026 leon byner: yeah. alan tudge: \u2026and our entire economic policy is built around growing the economy, growing wages in the process so the people who are wealthier and have greater opportunities. leon byner: the only way you can grow the economy is for there to be more economic activity\u2014to put on more people. alan tudge: and so i guess what we've been doing to create economic activity? we've been lowering taxes, \u00a0we've been building massive infrastructure right across the country; $75 billion worth including billions here in adelaide and across south australia. leon byner: so are you putting any money up on the table in your discussions today or is it just a philosophical thing? alan tudge: one of the main discussions will be in relation to what will be an adelaide city deal and that's where you have really three levels of government coming together and planning out what it might look like\u2026 leon byner: but any money? any money on the table though? alan tudge: inevitably there will be federal money which is put towards that city deal leon, as there will be state money and there may well be local money as well. so we\u2019ve done deals across the country, some very significant ones and i want to sit down with the premier today and start to shape out what an adelaide city deal might look like. leon byner: alright. now, i know you're the minister for population and this is adjacent to another portfolio but it's a breaking story and you\u2019re a member of cabinet and highly respected so it's only appropriate i ask you to unpack this a little bit\u2026 alan tudge: [laughs] i\u2019m waiting for this now leon, i\u2019m waiting for this. leon byner: now, we were told on 5aa news this morning that extremists could be stripped of their citizenship by the federal government even if they were born in australia. it goes on to say the majority of the 400 individuals monitored by asio are either dual citizens or entitled to foreign citizenship by descent. at the moment they can only have their passports cancelled. now, what are we saying- i know peter dutton he wants to do more, but you\u2019re going to need the parliamentary approval to do it aren\u2019t you? you\u2019re going to need labor support or the crossbenchers? alan tudge: for that type of proposal you would. now leon, we don't want extremists in australia. full stop. and we've been seeking out criminals out of the country at record levels if they're on visas. when they're australians it's obviously much more difficult because\u2026 leon byner: [interrupts] you\u2019ve got to change the law for that don\u2019t you? alan tudge: \u2026if you\u2019re an australian citizen and you have no citizenship elsewhere, under international law principles you can\u2019t kick them out of the country. what that proposal was which was i think flagged by michael sukkar and jason wood was that if a person is an australian but they've got eligibility for citizenship elsewhere then they may still be kicked out of the country if they\u2019re extremist. that\u2019s what their proposal was. now that\u2019s not formal government policy\u2026 leon byner: but you\u2019ve got to define what an extremist is. alan tudge: well that\u2019s right. so there\u2019s\u2026 leon byner: because the lawyers will love this. alan tudge: this has to be worked through but this is a very very serious issue now and we've particularly seen it in the last couple weeks in melbourne, as you know, where we've had terrorist threats, we've had terrorist incidents, we've had people stopped from committing mass atrocities just in the last two or three weeks. so it's a very serious issue. we're putting enormous resources around it and we\u2019re strengthening the law to be able to deal with it. leon byner: can i thank you for coming in today. and can i make one request on behalf of the people of this state. before we start talking about big infrastructure projects, which are always welcome, can we do something about the appalling condition of many of our roads? because seriously, i know we have highly reactive soil but that's not just a phenomenon for south australia that's everywhere. is there something we can do about that? alan tudge: the overall maintenance of the roads is obviously up to the state government and the local councils\u2026 leon byner: and they all say they\u2019re broke. alan tudge: well, we provide additional funding for- through the gst and through other mechanisms to the state governments to assist with those types of services. and then we tend to provide additional funding for the big infrastructure projects such as the north-south corridor or such as the flinders link or the gawler rail electrification but don\u2019t tend to do the local maintenance stuff. leon byner: listen, just quickly. we want to try and save the overland because we reckon it's a pretty good train. victoria are putting up some money. when you talk to steve marshall today can you- i mean the overland is an icon. i took calls on it yesterday, i'm still getting it on my social media. be assured people want that train service. alan tudge: well i'll see what steve marshall has to say today. leon byner: good. alan tudge, thank you for joining us. alan tudge: thanks very much leon.

it didn't sound absolutely nailed down. alan tudge: no, he was more talking about a process to be honest virginia, where the process may end up having a migration reduction but the process was us at the federal level setting a top-down migration number which then flows to the states and territories to deal with that population growth [audio skip] in the states and territories: how many people can you accommodate in your cities, in your states and then we'll do that bottom-up aggregation and deliver those numbers as much as possible to them. so it's quite a radical change to how we\u2019ll approach the population problem acknowledging that we've got the main growth levers at the federal level through the migration lever but the states and territories have to deliver the services, the infrastructure, the housing et cetera on the ground. virginia trioli: well i guess that's part of the problem isn\u2019t it, as you yourself have acknowledged in a key speech that you gave earlier this year. in a sense, you're handing that decision to state governments who according to every major and considered analyst on infrastructure in the country whether it be infrastructure australia or the regional economic development corporation or even the reserve bank have acknowledged it's been the states that have been lagging on building and providing that infrastructure, on investing in it. they're in catch up mode now but they've been lagging on for so long so you're handing that decision to them. is that wise? alan tudge:well we're giving more control to them too. we want to understand exactly what they're carrying capacity is in their cities and their states because as you say, they've got the large responsibility for delivering the infrastructure and the services to cater for population growth. virginia trioli: and they\u2019ve squibbed it. and they\u2019ve squibbed it. alan tudge: well in some cases they have and here in sydney - i'm from melbourne - but here in sydney, certainly a decade or so ago you had the premier of the day who was saying that sydney was full and not building for the future but at the same time just a few years later you had kevin rudd who turbocharged the migration intake much of which went into sydney. virginia trioli: you\u2019re conveniently only mentioning labor members there. alan tudge: but he had a complete disconnect. it was the most obvious disconnect between what was occurring federally through the population lever and what was occurring at the state level in terms of building infrastructure. ideally you\u2026 virginia trioli: well allow me to point out one more\u2026 alan tudge: my point is though ideally you have a closer alignment of those two things and that\u2019s what the prime minister's speech last night was about. virginia trioli: yep. alan tudge: now what that ends up being and looking like in terms of an overall migration number is likely a downward figure but let's wait and see what the states and territories say to us. virginia trioli: likely is an interesting term. but let me point out another disconnect and this is a very important one this morning: nine months ago - as treasurer - the prime minister said: if you cut the level of permanent immigration to australia by 80,000 that would cost the budget, that would hit the bottom line - the deficit - by 4 billion to 5 billion over the next four years. so we assume that your government is prepared to take that hit now? alan tudge: well last year's permanent migration figure came in at about 160,000 which was 30,000 below what our cap was in any case. now we're going to go through this process and yes there is a fiscal impact on the budget. virginia trioli: so you are prepared to take the hit? alan tudge: but there's also impacts in terms of congestion and liveability which people in melbourne and sydney particularly are facing right now because those two cities are absolutely booming as you probably know, virginia, and all - well in sydney's case 83 per cent of the growth into sydney is due to migration; in melbourne's case it\u2019s 65 per cent of the growth is due to migration. that\u2019s why we do have to have \u2026 virginia trioli: [interrupts] yes, but you're not dealing with the deficit. you\u2019re not dealing with the [indistinct] of the budget. alan tudge: \u2026 a closer look at this. virginia trioli: you're not dealing with that issue. well look if you will\u2026 alan tudge: we\u2019ll, inevitably we\u2019ll have to. that will be taken into account, of course it will be. virginia trioli: well this is what you said just earlier in the year - this is another disconnect: there are benefits of a larger more diverse population. a larger population means a larger economy. with this comes greater opportunities for australians. further, there is more scope for investment in public goods, including national defence. it's much easier to pay for submarines and the like with a trillion-dollar economy than one half the size. so you've had a change of mind on this as well. you see what i'm getting at here? alan tudge: i don't think so virginia. virginia trioli:\u00a0we\u2019ve got both you and the prime minister and the former treasurer changing your minds. alan tudge: virginia, with due respect - so with due respect virginia, i mean i've been consistent throughout this year saying that on the one hand migration does help grow our economy and it does. it does help lift living standards and it will continue to do so. it will continue to be a mainstay of australia. but that is balanced off against the congestion pressures particularly in melbourne and sydney which are getting so much of the population growth at the moment. now, interestingly enough it's a completely different conversation elsewhere in the country. now in south australia they want more people. in the northern territory - the same. in western australia, tasmania, equally the governments there want to grow their populations faster. so it's not a one size fits all and that's where we want to get to as well with our migration settings is to say that we want to support the aspirations and the capacity of each of those states to grow, so we can support the growth in some of the smaller states but we might ease the pressure on the growth in melbourne and sydney who are really struggling with the very rapid growth which they are facing at the moment - most of which is driven by migration. virginia trioli: just quickly before i let you go on another subject, your cabinet is tearing itself apart at the moment on the issue of australia's embassy in israel. where do you stand on the matter? where do you think the embassy should be? everyone's having a say now. alan tudge: well i wouldn't say that we're tearing ourselves apart. we've got a process \u2026 virginia trioli: oh goodness, i would. alan tudge: \u2026 which we\u2019re going through and obviously i'll follow the process and support that process. i can absolutely see the merits though of moving the embassy to jerusalem, where the capital of israel is. virginia trioli: you're in the moving camp? alan tudge: i'm saying that i can see the merits of it. it's the only country in the world where we don't have our embassy at the capital and in west jerusalem, it's not in dispute - that will always be the capital and i can see the merits of it but we've got a process and i'll support that process. virginia trioli: alan tudge, good to have you on the program. thanks so much. alan tudge: thanks very much virginia. "], "interview-keiran-gilvert-and-laura-jayes-sky-news": ["20 November 2018", "kieran gilbert: first though, laura, the focus on cutting the immigration intake, the population minister will be with us in just a moment. laura jayes: yeah, absolutely. the prime minister has flagged possible changes to australia\u2019s immigration ceiling, addressing the annual bradfield oration in sydney, scott morrison said the rate of population growth is putting pressure on infrastructure in our major cities. joining us now is the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, alan tudge. minister, thanks so much for your time. the prime minister has flagged this possible permanent reduction. what visa category would lose out? alan tudge: well, what the prime minister flagged last night was that instead of us setting the migration levels top down, we\u2019re going to reverse that and do a bottom up approach by asking the states and territories what are their population plans, what carrying capacity do they have in their big cities and in their states and then we\u2019ll aggregate the migration figures from there. now, we expect as a result of that process that the overall cap in the permanent migration intake will be lower than what it has been but let\u2019s go through that process first. kieran gilbert: so, when you look at this being the message from scott morrison, it does seem to be contradictory with his position in february of this year when he was arguing very strongly the treasury position that you cut migration, there\u2019s a hit to the budget. what\u2019s changed? alan tudge: and in fact last night in his bradfield oration, he still did discuss the economic benefits that we get from migration and they assist us growing our economy, they assist in terms of per capita growth as well. but we\u2019ve got to get the balance right and in part we\u2019ve got to get the balance also in the distribution of the growth because nearly all the population growth has been in our three big capitals of melbourne, sydney and brisbane whereas there\u2019s other parts of the country who are crying out for more people. and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying we need a much more nuanced approach to this population discussion and indeed to the migration discussion and understand exactly what the aspirations are and the carrying capacities and the desires of each of the big cities in the regions and try to build our population to support those aspirations in carrying capacity. and that\u2019s quite a different approach to what we\u2019ve done in the past. laura jayes: well, temporary and permanent visa categories would need to be considered according to the prime minister. so, what does that mean, would that potentially include limiting the number of student visas or tourist visas, do you rule any category of visas out here? alan tudge: well, this is part of the complexity of our migration program, when some people have come out and just argued, just straight out let\u2019s just cut the migration program. you\u2019ve got to consider the fact that half of the people who- about half of our permanent migration intake are from people who are already in the country on temporary visas and then they transition into permanent migration. and so, we\u2019ve got to be thinking about those temporary migration settings as well when we\u2019re considering our overall migration settings which of course then goes into our population discussion. and so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been foreshadowing to the states and territories as well. think very carefully about this, let\u2019s be careful that we don\u2019t interrupt very significant industries such as our international export industry, let\u2019s think about the businesses who need people and are sponsoring people in, the essential services that wouldn\u2019t be able to operate unless we had migrants coming into the country. at the same time understanding the fact that if everybody\u2019s coming into melbourne and sydney \u2013 and the vast majority do \u2013 it puts enormous pressure on those cities and we absolutely hear that. there is very significant congestion problems in those two big cities particularly. kieran gilbert: okay. ideally would you keep the- ideally would the government keep the immigration numbers where they are, the cap where it is, if you could ensure those coming into the country were settling outside of those two major cities? alan tudge: well, certainly one of the problems, kieran, is that we\u2019ve had nearly all of the population growth in those three areas; melbourne, sydney, south east queensland \u2013 where other parts of the country actually want to grow more quickly. in the regions today there\u2019s 46,000 job vacancies today and that\u2019s grown by 18 per cent over the last two years. so, the distribution of that growth is a key part of this. and what we want to do is that bottom up approach and have a much more tailored approach to our population and migration settings to cater for those different needs in different parts of the country. laura jayes: you as the population minister, alan tudge, can\u2019t identify- easily identify a category of visas that should be reduced, how do you expect the states to? alan tudge: well, some of the states have been calling publicly for a cut to the migration intake and we\u2019ve said- well, we\u2019re asking the states and territories what are your population plans? what are your aspirations? what are your carrying capacities in your big cities? and let\u2019s then have that discussion as we aggregate then up our overall migration program. now, we- at the moment we set a cap on the permanent migration program but most of the temporay migration programs are demand-driven; if we have more international students coming, they get an international tourist visa, or more tourists, more kiwis, et cetera. so, these are the discussions which we have to have and it\u2019s not a straight forward discussion. we\u2019ve set the cap at the permanent level but we want to most importantly understand the carrying capacity of those two big cities \u2013 melbourne and sydney \u2013 who are absolutely feeling the congestion pressures at the moment and slightly ease the pressure on them. kieran gilbert: is it likely that the government will just simply reduce the overall cap to the current intake? as we know, the government through the minister, mr dutton, have already reduced the numbers arriving nowhere near the cap of 190,000 a year. will you just reduce it to the current intake and say you\u2019ve done that and then you\u2019ve matched your rhetoric with some action on that front? alan tudge: no. we've announced we'll go through a process, and as the result of that process is likely going to be a reduction in the migration intake. but we'll go through that process and then determine it from there, kieran. laura jayes: so are you saying then it will be up to the states to, i guess, dictate the level of humanitarian visas? how is that- how should that be up to the states? alan tudge: well, in part, we- the key problem at the moment is in our federation in relation to this area is that we've got the main lever for population growth \u2013 being the migration lever \u2013 but the states and territories are responsible for delivering the infrastructure, the schools, the hospitals, the housing approvals, et cetera to cater for that growth. and what we're trying to do with this new approach is blend those two things together much more tightly so that you don't get a disconnect between population growth and the service delivery and the infrastructure delivery on the ground. and that, in course, includes all or all of the visa classes, laura, and that's the discussion which we want to have. we want to listen to what the states have got to say in relation to that and that will input into our final decision. at the end of the day, we will determine the migration settings but they will have a much stronger input into our settings. kieran gilbert: i want to ask you, just finally, before laura and i let you go. in relation to this breaking news we've got for our viewers at the bottom of the screen they can see that victoria police have arrested three men in melbourne over allegedly preparing and plotting terrorist acts. this comes on the day that melbourne sadly farewelled sisto malaspina, the victim of the most recent attack in your city. have you got any reaction to that breaking news this morning? alan tudge: you\u2019re telling me this for the first time, kieran, and i\u2019m glad the security agencies have caught these guys. these are really serious issues which we have to face and we have to work together on. and it\u2019s particularly, i think, poignant today given that we\u2019re having a state funeral for sisto and while melbourne is still mourning over his loss and still dealing with the consequences of the bourke street massacre. laura jayes: absolutely. alan tudge, thanks so much for your time this morning. alan tudge: thanks very much, laura and kieran.

[excerpt] scott morrison: the roads are clogged, the buses and the trains are full, the schools are taking no more enrolments, this is what is being reflected. [end of excerpt] neil mitchell: okay, this is what is being reflected by overpopulation and that includes immigration levels. he went on further though to say he didn't believe that - and this is a breakthrough because every time i've raised this somebody has put their head up and said, oh, you're just xenophobic or anti-migrant - he said the population are not actually anti-migrant. [excerpt] scott morrison: they're not anti-migration. they're not anti-migrants. i'm certainly not and in sydney we're certainly not, in melbourne they're certainly not, but they just want to know that the growth can be catered for by the infrastructure and the services that are going in. [end of excerpt] neil mitchell: of course that's part of it. the social cohesion is also a reasonable part of it. now i have debated that with scott morrison in the past. is it time to freeze, pause, cut? what actually is the detail? on the line, population minister, alan tudge. good morning. alan tudge: good morning neil. neil mitchell: freeze, cut, pause, what's the word? alan tudge: oh, we're likely to see a reduction in the overall migration intake as a result of the new process which we're going to undertake over the next few months and that is, neil, instead of us just setting a top-down number and then asking the states to deal with the consequences of the growth as a result, instead we will do a much more bottom-up approach. consult the states, ask what\u2019s their carrying capacity in their cities and their regions and build the migration up from the bottom and then set the overall number. neil mitchell: okay, well we're in state election campaign now. so you'll go to either matthew guy or daniel andrews and say how many can you handle? is that right? alan tudge: yes, that's right. so we'll have a much more detailed discussion with them. how many can you handle? what are your infrastructure plans? can you cope with this particular number and if not then we'll have to dial it back a bit.\u00a0 and certainly in melbourne and sydney nearly all of the growth has been from migration and melbourne is bursting at the seams, as you know neil and that's why it's an election issue at the moment and why matthew guy has got such strong policies in that area. neil mitchell:  well how much\u2026 alan tudge: but there's other parts - there are other parts of the country by the way that want more people\u2026 neil mitchell: okay. alan tudge: \u2026and that can't find workers. neil mitchell: how much of the country's population growth is from migration? alan tudge: about 60 per cent. neil mitchell: sixty per cent. alan tudge: about 60 per cent and this is of course even higher in different parts of australia. in melbourne\u2026 neil mitchell: well how many - what's the percentage in melbourne? alan tudge: \u2026 it\u2019s- 65 per cent of our growth into melbourne has been from migration. \u00a0in the last year 83 per cent of the growth into sydney is from migration. so you can sort of see the pressures which our high migration intake is putting on our two big capitals and we're all feeling it. everybody from melbourne - i'm from melbourne, neil - we all feel the pressures on our roads and on our streets. neil mitchell: so is it definite that there will be a reduction in the migration level? alan tudge: it's highly likely that the process will result in a reduction in the overall migration intake. now, we've already reduced it from what was a cap of 190,000 permanent migrants coming into the country. so last year it was 162,000. so there's already been a reduction but it's likely that there's going to be an ongoing reduction in the migration space. neil mitchell: well what if you don't agree? i mean the state ministers, the state treasurer, they're spending like drunken sailors. the state treasurer probably wants more migration for more money, for more taxes, to pay the bills. now what if he says no, no, we're happy with the level? does he decide? does the state government decide or do you over rule them? alan tudge: yeah, at the end of the day we have to make decisions in relation to the migration settings, but we want to make sure that they're much more closely aligned with what state governments can actually build and accommodate on the ground in our big cities. neil mitchell: so what if you don't agree? what if you don't agree? alan tudge: well at the end of the day we will have to make that decision in relation to the migration program. now, of course if matthew guy becomes premier i think he will have quite a different view in relation to the population pressures of melbourne particularly. he wants to see much greater decentralisation and we would be able to work with him in that regard, in particular using some of our visa settings to be able to accommodate that. neil mitchell: well, we'll\u2026 alan tudge: i think daniel andrews has a different view. neil mitchell: we'll ask both the premier and the opposition leader what their ultimate figure is, what the ideal figure is. we'll do that this morning. what will the process be? do you sit down to a meeting with them? do you have some sort of inquiry? or you just sit down with them, with the premiers and their treasurers or whatever and say, okay, this is the figure. alan tudge: yes. so we've already been having some of these discussions with the leaders or the states and territories, but we will be formally writing to the premiers and the chief ministers in the weeks ahead and then there will be a discussion at coag in december and then we will be making decisions following that. now these are careful considerations that need to be made because on the one hand we need migrants in some areas and some of our essential services rely on new migrants to be able to do the work. on the other we want to make sure that our cities are liveable. and you\u2019ve been discussing this neil, as you said, for a very long time, as have i.\u00a0 the roads are congested, some of the schools are full, the government hasn't been keeping up with the infrastructure and the housing and the hospitals, et cetera, to cater for that growth. neil mitchell: well we had in victoria just over 41,000 migrants in the year to- financial year to 2018, this year, this last financial year. who set that number? who set the 41,000 that came into victoria? alan tudge:  well that would be made up of a number of different components. so largely when migrants come into the country they can choose where they decide to go. now some of it will be employer sponsored, so by definition they'll go where the employer is, but other times they will come in through the general field migration program where you don't have a job at the end of it, but most end up coming to melbourne and sydney. neil mitchell: okay. alan tudge: and so we've got the ability though to create further incentives and indeed conditions for new people to come into the country and go to some of those smaller states that actually want to grow faster or the regions that need people. neil mitchell: do you agree this is now a social issue? i mean the prime minister is talking about and you are too, clogged roads and schools are full and social cohesion is part of it as well. alan tudge: i think that's absolutely right and that has to be a part of our population agenda. i have been talking with you about this neil, that there are some indicators now that we're not integrating people quite as well as we used to do in the past.\u00a0 now, we're still very good at it by the way by international standards, but we do want to make sure that we maintain our strong record of social cohesion and things like english language are very important, adopting australian values become critical and issues like that which we want to work on further as well. neil mitchell: thank you very much, the population minister, alan tudge.

alan tudge: from a permanent migration intake the cap is about 190,000 each year. and last year it came [indistinct]\u2026 jon faine: [talks over] do we ever meet the cap minister? alan tudge: we do and last year though we did come in under that at about 162,000. but what the prime minister was saying last night was that we want to approach this problem differently. but instead of the commonwealth setting a top-down number and the states and territories having to deal with the consequences of that, instead we want to do a bottom-up aggregation. understand exactly how many people the states and territories can cope with in terms of their infrastructure, the housing, the schools, the hospitals and then set the migration level based on that aggregated figure. jon faine: it\u2019s kind of a how long is piece of string argument though. but let\u2019s just clarify this, first of all, scott morrison says we\u2019ve been letting too many people in and he was the minister. the cap\u2019s 190, but we've in fact only been having 160,000. so to cut it from 190 to 160 means we're going to keep on admitting and accepting exactly the same number as we did last year. alan tudge: exactly, well it depends on exactly where we end up jon. we\u2019re going to go through this process. now the prime minister for [indistinct] \u00a0if we will end up in about that- it was about that figure, but let\u2019s go through the process of understanding exactly what the aspirations are and the carrying capacity of our big cities particularly and aggregate the migration figure from each of the state and territory\u2019s aspirations. jon faine: is this not pandering in particular to the anti-immigration activists which is kind of- i mean, it\u2019s a global move, we\u2019re not unique, we\u2019re not alone in doing this. but australia can absorb, can resettle, can integrate as many people as it damn well wants to. it\u2019s a matter of what efforts we make and how you organise yourselves and federal and state governments. alan tudge: i think that the challenge here in australia is that we've had very uneven distribution of growth. melbourne and sydney particularly have been growing like gangbusters. and the people are feeling the congestion pressures in melbourne \u2013 i\u2019m from melbourne as you know jon, absolutely the roads they're going slower, there\u2019s been pressure on house prices, there\u2019s enormous pressure on the cities at the moment. and we've been growing, believe it or not, melbourne added more people last year than almost any other english speaking city in the world, bar two. only atlanta and houston added more people. so we are growing very fast and i think our infrastructures been struggling to keep up because daniel andrew\u2019s government hasn't been doing enough frankly, and so we're going to be saying -\u00a0 can we ease the pressure on melbourne particularly and on sydney? because other parts of the country jon, that actually want more people and we want to fulfil those aspirations where we can as well. jon faine: so we don't actually dictate to people where they live unless we're for instance, letting in doctors specifically to work in rural communities in which case we say you're coming to work in a rural community, you have to work in a rural community. but the rest of the time we don't tell people where to live, it's not a soviet style planned economy is it? alan tudge: we actually already do have some visas which are geographically bound, so the 489 visa for example, does exactly that - where you have to work in a regional area. by and large, people do that for those two years and people don\u2019t tend to breach that visa. so there is an ability for us to provide incentives for people to go to the smaller cities or indeed to the regions in a strategic and targeted manner. and then to place conditions upon their visa to stay there for a few years, where in that time we hope they make it their home, they put down roots, their kids go to the school, they join the local footy and netball club and they make it their permanent home. \u00a0 jon faine: yesterday we were talking about an opinion poll that had been released which said that a growing number of australians, not a majority, but a growing number of australians were resistant to the idea of more migrants from muslim countries. is that part of this? alan tudge: we're always going to maintain a non-discriminatory immigration policy, but the people need to satisfy- we need to be satisfied that people are adopting australian values, they need to sign up to those. we obviously, you have to go through security checks and they have to meet other visa conditions to get into the country. jon faine: separately, i noticed that two of your colleagues in the morrison ministry have been involved in a bit of a spat with each other. josh frydenberg is pursuing as vigorously as he can, an agenda for australia to move its embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem. christopher pyne, senior minister in the government from south australia, told media yesterday he thought that that was a conversation that people should stop and mr frydenberg hit back and was making various comments about mr pyne. is this an issue that the government wants us all to be thinking about and talking about every day? alan tudge: i don't know if the entire population is talking about this every single day jon. within my community it\u2019s not really an issue which bubbles to the surface. it's an important issue for the government to consider and the prime minister has said - let\u2019s be open to moving our embassy across to jerusalem, after all that is the capital of israel. and it\u2019s the only country in the world that we don\u2019t have our embassy at the capital and in the location where we're talking about, it\u2019s not in disputed territory. so that's a conversation which we're having, we're going through a process and we\u2019ll making a decision shortly in relation to it. jon faine: so i think it's the australian newspaper today, discloses that the department when julie bishop was the minister advised against it - the foreign affairs department. don\u2019t we usually just take their advice and that\u2019s the end of it? alan tudge: i mean, in all cases if you listen very closely to the advice of your departmental officials. but then the government of the day has to make a decision and we're going through this process now and at the end of that process the government will make a decision and i can see frankly, some merits in moving as many of my colleagues can. but there\u2019s a process which we\u2019re undertaking and we'll let that process go its course. jon faine: thank you for your time this morning on all of those issues. alan tudge, is the minister in scott morrison\u2019s coalition federal government. he\u2019s the minister for population. "], "interview-fran-kelly-rn-breakfast": ["20 November 2018", "fran kelly: the prime minister scott morrison is flagging a permanent cut to the nation\u2019s immigration rate. the pm says he\u2019s hearing the message loud and clear that australians are fed up with clogged roads, full buses and trains, and overcrowded schools and hospitals. without actually committing it to a new annual cap, the prime minister has hinted the intake could be reduced by around 30,000 people a year to take the pressure off our biggest cities; and he\u2019s inviting input from the states in helping to set the new number. alan tudge is the minister for cities and population, or as scott morrison puts it, the minister for congestion busting. minister, welcome back to breakfast. alan tudge: g\u2019day, fran. fran kelly: the prime minister says: enough, enough, enough and cities like sydney and melbourne have become victims of their own success. if that\u2019s the case, why not just cut the immigration number and be done with it because the commonwealth controls the levers? alan tudge: that\u2019s true. so we control the main population growth lever\u2026 fran kelly: [talks over] yeah. alan tudge: \u2026which of course is immigration. it accounts for 60 per cent of our population growth, but the states and territories are responsible for building the infrastructure and the housing and the schools and the hospitals to cater for that population growth. so, in essence, what we are saying is we\u2019d much rather have a bottom-up process in relation to population growth, assess what the carrying capacity is of the major cities and the regions; and in large part, deliver the population to meet that carrying capacity. fran kelly: okay. there was already a revision of the cap this year from 190 down to about to 162 i think it was. the pm suggested last night that that\u2019s probably about right; that\u2019s probably about where it will end up. is that where you agree it should be? alan tudge: well, we\u2019ll have to go through the process. so the process now will be that the prime minister will discuss this with each of the states and territories. they will tell us what their plans are; what the population should be in their particular state and territories; what infrastructure they have to cater for that; and then the population number, in essence, will be an aggregation of those figures.   so, it will likely mean a reduction in the migration intake but we\u2019ll go through the process to determine that. fran kelly: but the pm\u2019s already got a feel for it. he said last night it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if any process we went through will arrive in that sort of territory \u2013 that sort of territory of 30,000 below where it\u2019s been. alan tudge: well, that\u2019s where we have been in the last couple of years, fran. so the cap is 190,000. last year, we came in at 162,000. when we go to the states and territories and ask them: what do you want the population numbers to be in your cities? what infrastructure do you have to meet that? do you have the carrying capacity for it? and when you add up these numbers, we expect it to come in around that number, but we\u2019ll wait and see. fran kelly: the truth is many of our cities have nowhere near the infrastructure to carry the population they have. so what if the states say: well, we want this number, but they don\u2019t have the infrastructure plan? could the cap [indistinct] way down? alan tudge: [talks over] well, we want to have a look at that. we want to have a look at what their plans are. so each of the states and territories should have quite a clear view as to what their carrying capacity is; what their infrastructure pipeline looks like; and therefore, how many people they can accommodate without overburdening that city. now, we're going to have different results, by the way fran, in different parts of the country. i fully expect in south australia, in the northern territory, in western australia, in tasmania that they'll be asking for more people because having spoken with those governments, they want to grow their populations, whereas in victoria and new south wales, we're particularly feeling the pressure in melbourne and sydney because most of the migration goes into those two big capitals. fran kelly: infrastructure cost a lot of money, of course; immigration brings in money; and the pm actually is not committing to anything yet, of course. this was just the speech last night. the government has been split in this year over the immigration level. back in february when tony abbott proposed the number of immigrants to be cut by 80,000, scott morrison was treasurer at the time and he knocked the idea on the head by warning that such a resolution would cost the budget for $4 to $5 billion over four years. how much would an annual cut of 30,000 hit the budget? alan tudge: well, we already have that figure last year, so those figures were already locked in effectively into the budget figures last year. now, of course, there is a balance here because migration does \u2026 fran kelly: [interrupts] so you\u2019re saying it wouldn't be a knock to the budget in the way 80,000 would have been a knock to $4 or $5 billion over four years. alan tudge: well, absolutely. of course, the migration number has an impact on the budget figures but this is an overall balance. now, migration brings growth; it brings skills; it brings younger people into the population to better cater for the ageing population. so it's very important that we do maintain a strong migration intake, particularly a skilled migration intake, but that's got to be balanced out in terms of the population pressures which particularly melbourne and sydney are feeling. now, the listeners from melbourne and sydney will fully understand how congested those roads are now; the pressure which has been put on some of the services, the schools, on property prices and the like. other parts of the country, though, will be saying: actually, we want to grow faster and we want to tailor our population approach, if you like, in our migration approach, to as much as possible deal with those different aspirations of the cities. fran kelly: [talks over] but just let me get this clear, though, because there\u2019s sort of two messages. at the same time, the pm seems to be promising a smaller immigration intake of around 30,000. you seem to think that's where it would fall. he acknowledged last night, again, that population growth along with productivity will become even more important for sustaining strong growth in national living standards as the ageing of the population weighs on workforce participation. so, in other words, we need more migrants to keep up the economy and to be able to support the population change and the ageing population. so we need more migrants but a cut around 30 should still keep the balance right. is that what you\u2019re saying? is that what you think? alan tudge: well, in essence, that's effectively what we're saying although we haven't specified the precise number because that will come out through the process. we expect it may end up being in maybe a reduction of 30,000 or so but let's go through that process.  but it is a balance, fran. we still need to have migrants coming into the country for those reasons that you're talking about and it does assist all of us in terms of living standards, a growing economy, greater opportunities, dealing with the ageing of population but that does have to be balanced down against the liveability, particularly of our big cities which receive the vast bulk of the migration intake. fran kelly: so we've been talking about this for much of this year but still there's no population plan. when will we get some firm numbers or is this the government talking about population immigration because you know they\u2019re hot button issues and we\u2019re heading to an election? alan tudge: [talks over] no. well, no because we've got a coag meeting in mid-december so the prime minister has \u2026 fran kelly: [talks over] what will come from that? alan tudge: so the prime minister has foreshadowed that he\u2019ll be writing to the premiers and chief ministers shortly and he's putting this on the agenda for coag to discuss it at that particular stage; and we'll work through the process that particular way.  now, as i said, i expect, for example, the chief minister- the premier of south australia will say: we want to grow south australia. can you support our aspirations? where it\u2019s almost certainly that gladys berejiklian here in new south wales, will be saying: actually, we need to slow down the growth slightly here in the new south wales. fran kelly: [talks over] and when will you reveal the plans of how you might manage that \u2013 assign some migrants, new arrivals to different states? alan tudge: yeah. so we're working through those processes now. now, we\u2019ve already \u2026 fran kelly: [talks over] i think this is my third interview where i\u2019ve talked to you about this. when are you going to have some firm plans? alan tudge: [talks over] yeah. but we\u2019ve always said in terms of the broader population plan, we\u2019d be looking at early next year in terms of revealing fully that. but you can start to see a flavour of where we're going now \u2013 a much more bottoms-up approach to the migration intake tailored to the particular needs of the cities. that might end up being with an overall migration intake nationally but we want to support those places that want to grow while easing the pressure off the big cities. fran kelly: the annual migrant intake pales in comparison to the number of people on temporary visas. i think there's around 600,000 international students studying in australia, for instance, all of them need to be housed, they need to use the roads, the public transport, the buses - if you're serious about taking the pressure off the big cities you're going to have to look at those numbers as well. alan tudge: well prime minister morrison foreshadowed this last night to say that the states and territories need to have a very close look at this, because about half of the permanent migrants were already in the country as temporary migrants before they become permanent migrants. so if you like, we've got to look earlier in the process to sort of say well, what's going on there? and let's be very careful about this because where for example our university- international education industry is a very strong industry does very well for us. so we want to be very careful that we don't interrupt that too much. and so that's why we're just taking it steadily. that's why we're asking the states and territories to be quite thoughtful about this, really consider the consequences of what they're putting forward and then we'll come together and aggregate that into the migration plan. fran kelly: you\u2019re listening to rn breakfast. it\u2019s 7:45, our guest is alan tudge. he\u2019s the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population. there was a poll yesterday - ipsos poll showing that 46 per cent of voters want to see the migration intake from muslim countries lowered; 35 per cent say it should stay the same. the government now seeming to blame migrants for the fact that our big cities are full. is there a danger that these two issues could become conflated? are you worried about sort of ugliness seeping into this debate? alan tudge: listen we've been discussing this for several months now, fran, as you know, and particularly melbourne and sydney which are facing these congestion challenges. now the bottom line is that most of the population growth has been driven by migration in those two cities. indeed, in sydney last year 83 per cent of the growth of sydney was due to migration. so of course it is a factor but it's been the lack of infrastructure build in the past which has actually caused the population pressures. fran kelly: [interrupts] i\u2019m talking about conflating it with this issue of muslim migration which is actually a very small component of our overseas migration, isn\u2019t it? alan tudge: yeah, yeah, it is and will always have a \u2026 fran kelly: what size is it, do you know? alan tudge: we\u2019ll always have a non-discriminatory immigration policy fran, but people when they come into the country obviously have to commit to adopting australian values and that's all we ask for. they've got to pass security checks and they've obviously got to get through the visa hurdles to get into the country. fran kelly: where are we at on that values test you spoke to us about earlier this year? you were saying we needed one to fend off what you called segregation in our big cities and that ended up feeding the african gangs debate in your home town of melbourne, but where we are at in terms of that values test? alan tudge: so there's still work going on in relation to that, fran. now this is one of the issues which we do have to address and address maturely and sensibly is the social cohesion of our big cities and we want to maintain that social cohesion. we've done so well in the past in relation to that and we want to ensure that we can continue to maintain that social cohesion. so it's part of our population policy if you like. we've got to get the growth numbers right. we've got to maintain the social cohesion and of course we have to make sure that we get the demographics right as well to be able to tailor- to be able to cater for the ageing population. fran kelly: the demographics of who we bring in \u2013 you mean the age? alan tudge: the demographics of who we bring in. so on average for example the migrants who come into the country, they are aged- the average age is 26 years. now that's a great age that they come in because they are in the working age, they're contributing to the country. and if we don't maintain at least a reasonable proportion of migrants coming in, in that working age, then we\u2019ll quickly find we do have an ageing population. fran kelly: but that\u2019s what we do have anyway, so why would we think we wouldn\u2019t? alan tudge: well so, we will be, but our whole discussion here is about what the level of migration is going to be, post the process which we go through. and so we've got to balance these things out is my point. fran kelly: alan tudge \u2026 alan tudge: there\u2019s good economic reasons to maintain a strong migration intake but we're balancing it out particularly with the enormous pressures which melbourne and sydney are under. fran kelly: alan tudge, thank you very much for joining us. alan tudge: thanks very much fran. fran kelly: alan tudge is the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population. your listening to rn breakfast.

[indistinct]- ray hadley: \u2026so- if the- you go to the meeting 12 december and then you- we have a christmas break and no one does anything until you know 15 february and then we have an election almost upon us, so what's the timeframe? alan tudge: and so you have some very clear ideas as to about where exactly we're going by early next year, ray. so the process from here is the prime minister's going to formally write out to the states and territories. there will be that- the meeting, the coag meeting of the prime minister and the leaders in december, and then we'll be finalising this in the early parts of next year. now, overall, we expect that the results of this new process will see a drop in the migration intake. we\u2019ve already dropped it by the way, from 190 down to 162,000; and we'll see what the result is from that process. it might end up, though, that in south australia, there\u2019s actually more people going to that area \u2013 same with the northern territory; they absolutely want more people up there and other parts of the country too, including even in parts of new south wales such as dubbo, which are struggling to find workers at the moment. ray hadley: alright then. appreciate your time. let\u2019s see what happens on 12 december. thank you very much, minister. alan tudge: thanks very much, ray. ray hadley: alan tudge, minister for cities, urban infrastructure, population. as i said, states don't make immigration policy, federal governments do, and they should be doing it without blaming the states at the moment. don't tell me that if we just reduce it down from the figure that it was \u2013190, its down closer to 160 now \u2013 get it back to 130, 140 and just say the special visas are, you either go to the northern territory, south australia, or regional parts where there are jobs. and i look at the unemployment rate in dubbo before i started sending people to dubbo or anywhere else in regional australia.

urban infrastructure and population alan tudge said many of the projects will collect valuable, sensor based data that, once analysed, could mean sharing the projects nationally, and internationally. \u201cthis program helps local governments who are pushing the boundaries with new ideas to address liveability issues that are facing local communities everywhere,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cmany of these projects will increase the productivity and sustainability of australia\u2019s cities and towns,\u201d he said. successful projects include logan city council who will receive $250,000 towards their flooded roads smart warning system project that will provide real time warning signs activated during flooding. wollondilly shire council\u2019s project, western sydney parkland city sensor network, will receive $700,000, building on the western sydney city deal. \u00a0 the project will deploy a sensor network across the western parkland city to collect data that will be used to reduce congestion and increase efficient use of lighting and irrigation in public areas. the project builds on the collaboration underpinning the western sydney city deal to set up a unified data framework across the eight councils that will enable partnership into the future. launceston city council will install a traffic management system across the city that synchronises traffic signals to optimise the flow of traffic and, most importantly, provide the ability to prioritise emergency vehicles. mr tudge said the 32 projects announced around the country are pioneering and aim to reduce things like congestion on our roads, energy consumption and reduce waste. \u201ctoday\u2019s announcement follows $27.7 million in coalition government funding being allocated to 49 highly successful projects around the nation under round one of the program in november 2017. \u201cround one supported a range of activities, including trialling a driverless electric shuttle in perth to help reduce congestions, a city-scale transport, energy and digital infrastructure network in newcastle and cctv, smart lighting and parking in darwin. \u201cthe program encourages collaboration between local governments, industry, research organisations, tech start-ups and manufacturers in cities and towns across australia. these partnerships in turn support the growth of emerging industries and help

with modern infrastructure to support growth and maximise opportunities in western sydney,\u201d senator payne said. \u201conce complete, the northern road upgrade will enhance access between penrith and south western sydney which will result in shorter travel times and boost motorist safety.\u201d federal member for hume angus taylor said stage 4 of the northern road upgrade between mersey road and eaton road was expected to open to traffic in 2021. \u201conce complete, this major arterial upgrade will improve transport connections between penrith, the m4 motorway, western sydney airport and all surrounding areas,\u201d mr taylor said. \u201ca new pedestrian and cycling path will also be built on the western side of the northern road and pedestrian paths on the eastern side of the northern road where required. \u201cthanks to the community and motorists for their patience and we\u2019ll continue to keep everyone informed as the project progresses.\u201d state member for camden chris patterson said stage 4 of the northern road upgrade will be welcomed by camden residents who use the northern road each day.\u00a0 \u201ci congratulate both the coalition government and the nsw government on the continued road upgrades in and around the camden area,\u201d mr\u00a0 patterson said. the coalition government has committed $1.2\u00a0billion towards the $1.6\u00a0billion northern road upgrade, in partnership with the new south wales government. for more information about the upgrade, visit http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-west/the-northern-road/stage-3/index.html.

projects\u2014have been granted priority status by infrastructure australia, paving the way for construction. federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population alan tudge said the independent advisory board had added the projects\u2014part of western australia's metronet rail program\u2014to its infrastructure priority list. \u201cbeing added to this list means wa is a step closer to solving some major congestion issues,\u201d mr tudge said. \u201cthese projects will bust congestion on perth's road and rail networks, it's a $700\u00a0million contribution from the coalition government towards completing these rail links which will have a huge impact on everyday life in the city, and the state. the metronet: thornlie\u2013cockburn link will enhance the existing passenger rail network by providing a 17.5-kilometre extension connecting the existing thornlie rail line to cockburn central station on the mandurah line. connecting the mandurah and armadale lines will also open up new opportunities for integrated liveable communities around the proposed nicholson road station and better public transport connections for the light industrial area surrounding ranford road. mr tudge said infrastructure priority listing of the thornlie-cockburn link and the yanchep rail extension is a significant metronet milestone. \u201cit demonstrates why the australian government committed $3.2\u00a0billion in the 2018\u201319 budget for network shaping projects in western australia such as metronet, which together are expected to generate over 20,000 jobs across

world\u2019s great tropical cities, darwin. it\u2019s great to be here in northern australia. it\u2019s great to be here in one of australia\u2019s great cities, darwin. it\u2019s great to be here with the chief minister, the mayor and the leader of the opposition, clp candidates and luke, the local member. it\u2019s great to be here together and particularly with alan tudge, the minister, to be here to announce what is a very big deal for darwin. it\u2019s a very big deal for the territory and it\u2019s a very big deal for australia. it\u2019s a deal that brings together all three levels of government to focus on the future of our most important cities. a city that has been all sorts of history over a long period of time, which we\u2019ll be marking in a very special way a little later today with a visit with prime minister abe. but here, what we\u2019re looking at is the future of this city, to be a leading light for other tropical cities around the world. what we\u2019re announcing today is a cities deal which will see around half a billion dollars invested in its\u2019 future over the next ten years. the commonwealth, together with the territorian government as well as the city council, coming together to invest in projects which will enliven this city. now, from the commonwealth\u2019s point of view, that involves just over $100 million of investments, principally when it comes to charles darwin university to create a vertical campus right here in the middle of the city of darwin, which will bring some 1,100 students into the middle of the city, increasing the vibrancy of the city and bringing future territorians to darwin where they will come and they will study and they will live. the plan is that they will hopefully stay and embrace the wonderful tropical city life of what is darwin. this is a project that will see a great boost, not only in construction works that will take place, but a long-term viable, sustaining, driving force in the heart of the city of darwin. now, on top of that, there will be some important works that we\u2019ve funded, just under $5 million that is looking at the tropical city management process here in darwin. the greening of the city, its\u2019 temperature management, these are challenges which are being faced by tropical cities all around the world. now i have just come from the east asia summit in singapore and the issue of managing these types of issues in tropical cities is one of the biggest challenges being faced by countries in our region today. whether it\u2019s in malaysia or singapore or indonesia or vietnam or other places, one of the key initiatives, the new cities initiative that we are part of in the region, is taking the expertise that we have developed here in australia and exporting that to the world in terms of how you manage and plan and develop cities in tropical locations. so with the csiro we\u2019ll be working here to manage an urban city lab which will be looking at those tropical city management design issues and project issues. i think that\u2019s going to be real boost, not just for the city of darwin to be one of the lead tropical cities in the world, but on top of that it will ensure important export business for services and technology that will further boost the australian economy. in addition to that, we\u2019ve got stokes hill land area just behind us, which will be made available to go through a process to ensure that it can be put to best possible use, particularly working together closely with the larrakia people for whom this is a very important piece of land in the northern te rritory. we work consultatively with them and with the territory government to ensure that\u2019s put to its best and most appropriate use. but also as nigel scullion has been championing, this deal has a jobs guarantee for indigenous australians. a jobs guarantee, to ensure that indigenous people are employed on the projects that go into this deal and it also includes $2 million to support the larrakia people and their economic development here in the territory. so, this is a deal that will make our economy stronger. this is a deal that will make the territory stronger and it\u2019s a deal that i think will improve the living standards and livelihoods of people who live in darwin. not just today, but the many more that we hope will come and live in this tropical city of the future here in darwin. i want to thank again michael gunner the chief minister here, i want to thank kon the mayor, i particularly want to thank alan tudge who has brought this to a conclusion today with our partners. as the minister responsible, i think he\u2019s done an extraordinary job, not just here but many of the other deals we have been able to announce in recent times, so well done alan. and i\u2019m going to pass on to the chief minister and congratulate him again on the win. hon michael gunner, northern territory chief minister: thank you, prime minister. this is an exciting day. today, the australian government, the territory government, darwin city council are investing in darwin as the capital of northern australia. this is an investment that will drive the creation of local jobs here in darwin and in the territory. we will now see more students, more international students call darwin home. we\u2019re now going to see a greener, more tropical darwin. we\u2019ve already started that investment with the creation of extra parkland in the heart of our cbd and the start of cavenagh street shade trial and this will be driven by that csiro living lab. we see darwin as not near asia but in asia. we see darwin as a driver of economic activity and we want, we have a vision for darwin to service our northern neighbours, the wider region. we see our competition as singapore, not sydney. that\u2019s what we want to do and this investment drives and supports that vision. i thank the prime minister, i thank the lord mayor, i thank the vice-chancellor, the minister alan tudge, everybody who\u2019s helped deliver this vision, the larrakia people who have bought into this vision for darwin. this is a very exciting day as we celebrate today the first gas of inpex and that major project, i think it\u2019s perfectly fitting that we celebrate this, another major investment into darwin, the place that we call home and that we love. thank you very much. lord mayor kon vatskalis: well, it is a tropical city as you can see. but this is the deal that will change darwin. we\u2019re not going to be a city in australia, far away from everywhere. we\u2019re going to be the centre between australia and asia. this deal between the federal government and the territory government and the darwin city council is very important for darwin. they\u2019re putting $100 million investment, we\u2019re putting one of the biggest and the only available block in the middle of the city for the university to be placed there. $25 million worth of land that if it was not there, you couldn\u2019t put a university in the middle of the city. a university that will change the face of the city, not only the students but the businesses around that are there now or that will develop to support the university. greening the city, finding solutions for this hot city that is getting hotter. greening the city, putting public art in the streets, in our parks. it is not \u201cwe may think about it,\u201d but now, \u201cit will happen\u201d. it will change darwin as we know it. thank you. minister alan tudge: well, thanks, prime minister. we\u2019ve now signed a number of city deals around the country and each one has a different theme. the most recent one, the geelong city deal, is very much about stimulating the tourism economy. the western sydney city deal is about creating a new city almost, built around the western sydney airport. this one is about really developing the heart and soul of darwin itself to grow it, to make it more liveable and to activate the city centre. as the prime minister said, the central investment from the commonwealth\u2019s perspective is to build a brand new university campus right in the heart of the city and that means you\u2019ll have 11,000 students there on a daily basis, spilling out into the streets, purchasing food at the local cafes and restaurants and enjoying life in darwin and hopefully making it their home forever. it also provides a tremendous opportunity though for international students. i know the vice-chancellor is particularly keen on that university because the northern territory only gets about 0.2 per cent of all international students, despite having about one per cent of the population here. there\u2019s real opportunity for international student growth into this city and that brings people, but it also brings money, because every international student, on average, brings about $44,000 into the local economy, half in fees, the other half in expenditure. so, there\u2019s huge economic potential here as well from this deal. can i just thank the chief minister and the mayor and the mayor and also the vice-chancellor for working so cooperatively together to land this particular deal, but it\u2019s amazing what you can achieve when the three levels of government work cooperatively, honestly, thrash things out together and land something really significant which will shape our city here for the next decade. thank you. prime minister: let\u2019s take some questions on the city deal and as i\u2019ve said before, if there are some other matters, we can deal with those separately. journalist: what evidence is there that bring university students to the city centre will revitalises the economy? prime minister: i\u2019ve seen this firsthand in my own city in liverpool, western sydney university went and put a very large vertical campus there and that is now the biggest training centre for nurses in new south wales. it has completely transformed the city of liverpool and interestingly, because alan just referred to it, one of the reasons the campus was put there in liverpool was because of the investments we\u2019d made in the city deal around the western sydney airport. it all makes sense and so these investments create momentum. they are catalysts and to bring 1,100 people into the centre of darwin, 1,100 in terms of the students, then this will ensure that we are rapidly increasing the money that is churning around in the darwin economy. so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in liverpool in sydney, we\u2019ve seen it in other places around the country and this will be a significant investment. journalist: it\u2019s less money than the money provided for townsville and for the launceston. why is there $100 million for darwin more than for other cities? prime minister: well, every city deal is different and every city deal deals with the projects. i mean, it\u2019s not a league table of investment, what it is it\u2019s a project-based approach. what are the right projects to actually get the city moving in the right direction? the selection of projects that is being done here\u2014we\u2019re doing a series of projects, the territory government is investing in projects like the arts centre and others\u2014and it\u2019s the combination of those projects which is what matters. then the government stepped up with the funding required to make it happen. now, i should stress that on top of what we\u2019ve put in, in terms of our investment in direct funding, there is also the opportunity for further support to be provided through the northern australia infrastructure fund so there is additional opportunity for us to be involved here and that will be a function of those projects as they\u2019re further developed. journalist: malcolm turnbull, when he came to tennant creek a couple of months ago, proposed a regional deal for the barkly region. where are things at with that? prime minister: i\u2019ll be having a bit more to say about that at lunchtime. journalist: why did you block access to your letter offering the gst top-up, which refers to fracking\u2014 prime minister: why don\u2019t we just stay, we\u2019ll stay on the city deal and we can deal with other political issues later. are there other questions to the chief minister and the lord mayor or alan on the issue of the city deal? journalist: what projects are you expecting will be good for regenerating the city stokes hill wharf site? prime minister: well, this has to be consultative process on the stokes hill site and i\u2019m not going to pre-empt that and that consultation. particularly that consultation has to be undertaken with the larrakia people. but i\u2019ll let the chief minister speak on that. chief minister gunner: there are two projects that have been identified as possible for that site amongst others. one is obviously the larrakia cultural centre and there\u2019s investment through the city deal for doing a business case around that. we\u2019ve also flagged around the corner from there, the potential for a water park to be on that site as well. so there\u2019s a couple of projects that may be for that site, that\u2019s not to rule out potential for others to be there as well. obviously, what we\u2019ve done through the c ity deal is agree to work together about clearing those old fuel tanks there and rehabilitating the site and working on that. journalist: just another question for the prime minister. will the federal government commit any funding to revitalise kakadu? prime minister: we\u2019re currently working through that issue. nigel scullion, the senator is working with the territory government and i know gary has written to us as well about some issues with kakadu. but coming out of the tourism industry, i probably know better than most from the southern states how important kakadu is to the northern territory tourism industry. so we\u2019re aware of the issues there and i\u2019ve been working closely with the territory government. today, we\u2019re here talking about darwin and once we\u2019re in a position to say more about those matters, then i will. journalist: why did you block access to your letter of offering the gst to the territory? prime minister: are we done with the city deal, because there will be different people standing at the microphone if we\u2019re going to talk about politics. well, i\u2019m glad to see everybody is excited about the city deal. we\u2019re excited about the city deal as is gary as is kathy and of course, as is jacinta, great to have you here. so, why don\u2019t we thank you very much and of course the vice-chancellor. journalist: later today, you\u2019ll meet with shinzo abe. how does it feel to be the first prime minister to meet with the japanese prime minister since wwii? prime minister: here in darwin? well, i\u2019ve had the opportunity to discuss this with shinzo abe during the recent summit i\u2019ve just been attending in singapore and he\u2019s looking forward to being in darwin. this is going to be a very significant day for darwin with his visit, not just because of the marking of the fact that the first shipment of gas to come out of the inpex project which has been an enormous investment, the single largest investment ever by japan in australia. but it will be, i think, a very sombre time, particularly for australians all around the country, wherever they are, whether they\u2019re in darwin or they\u2019re in other parts of the country and they were here at the time of the raids, or had family members who were killed, over 230 during those raids. i think this is an important time of healing. it\u2019s an important time of reconciliation and for some, i know that will always be difficult, who were directly touched by those events. but what i do know is that the humility of prime minister abe\u2019s attendance here today and the way he has approached similar issues in other parts of the world, says a great deal, not only about his character as a leader and his vision as a leader, but it says a lot about the relationship between japan and australia. we share so much in common in this part of the world and we have a very similar outlook on how issues need to be managed in this part of the world. i\u2019ll be looking forward to discussing those with him further today. obviously, those of you who were up with me in singapore know that those formal discussions have already commenced and we\u2019ll have a lot more today. i\u2019m very much looking forward to welcoming him here today and i think it will be an important visit, not just for darwin, but for australia. journalist: pm, could you speak to the strategic implications of what you and prime minister abe will be signing today, with the view to the region, with a view to the tensions between china and the us which we saw writ large in singapore? prime minister: we both have a very similar outlook when it comes to managing our relationships with two important partners. japan has a very important strategic partnership with the united states, as do we. they also have a very significant trade relationship with china and a broader relationship, as do we. so i think in getting together and talking about the many tense issues that exist in managing both of those relationships, i think it\u2019s a very positive way of taking all of our relationships forward. we\u2019re basically dealing with the same set of issues. so to round that out, whether it\u2019s on defence issues, whether it\u2019s on trade issues, we are working very closely together and identifying more and more ways to do that. the defence and foreign ministers met in sydney recently and that further implemented a whole range of more cooperative activity in terms of joint activities and exercises and that\u2019s been continuing. we\u2019re very keen to see how that can be progressed to the future and we\u2019ll have more to discuss on that topic today. but the trade issues around rcep and the potential additional participants in the tpp which prime minister abe was instrumental in ensuring that that deal came together along with our former prime minister, mr turnbull and the former prime minister of new zealand, john key. so prime minister abe i know, sort of carries a great deal of ownership of that arrangement and his intention as is ours is to see others join that relationship in the future. journalist: [inaudible] right to be concerned that chinese investment could affect australian democracy, openness and transparency, perhaps in this country but maybe also in the region? prime minister: no, i don\u2019t share that view. journalist: prime minister, do you expect this will be an awkward or uncomfortable visit of the japanese leader, having had the chance to speak with him? prime minister: no, i don\u2019t. because he has undertaken similar visits around the world in similar locations with similar history and he approaches this with an authenticity and a humility which comes very naturally to him. i think that will greatly assist in putting at ease some of the very deep feelings that are around this issue, so i think he\u2019s demonstrated very well and in a very positive way at how these visits can actually take the issue forward, provide a moment of reflection and healing and continue to reinforce the relationship in very positive terms. journalist: why did you block access to, basically, your never offering gst top-up to the northern territory, that refer to the lifting of the moratorium? because the australia institute has basically alleged- prime minister: the australia institute? oh, the australia institute, that well-known, independent think-tank. okay. journalist: they are an environmental think-tank. prime minister: they\u2019re a left-wing think-tank, so let\u2019s not say they don\u2019t have any partisan bias. okay, next. journalist: okay, is that why you refused access? prime minister: no. journalist: so if i applied, would you give me the letter? prime minister: no. the gst issue in the northern territory and the decision of the northern territory government in relation to gas were unrelated. i\u2019ve said that, the northern territory government said that. they\u2019ve made their decision, we made our decision. i applaud their decision, i did at the time. more than $250 million has been put in top-ups to the northern territory government and that\u2019s to ensure that they can meet their obligations here to essential services in the territory. this has been a significant investment by our government. we understand the needs of territorians and that\u2019s why we were so quick to provide that support and that will be backed up by another $69 million. so the northern territory government for that, $500 million for remote indigenous housing over the next five years. this is another part of the important partnership so our government is investing heavily, heavily in the territory because of the unique challenges that are faced here. i mean, we\u2019ve talked about the $100 million and more going into the city deal today. but that comes on top of $100 million we\u2019ve already put into road infrastructure and congestion management projects here in darwin already. so, we\u2019re doing a lot of investment here in the north. journalist: is it appropriate to invite japanese families to grieve in darwin in the same place the australians gathered will? prime minister: we\u2019ll continue to work sensibly through those issues. journalist: mr morrison, you said that the nsc will have a role in reviewing the israel embassy shift, whether they\u2019re doing it or not. will they take into account the views of dr mahathir about raising the terrorist risk? prime minister: australia sets foreign policy in australia, nobody else. journalist: and what did you make of josh frydenberg\u2019s comments on radio this morning? he\u2019s saying that dr mahathir comments should be taken with a grain of salt. prime minister: well, dr mahathir i had the opportunity to meet with yesterday. he raised these issues, i must say, quite courteously, at the end of the meeting. that was not only expected, he raised them and i think what josh said today was basically a bit of filling in the history of his record on various issues over time. i think those issues are well-known and his contributions to the public record on these topics are well-known, they go back a long way through many, many prime ministers, going back to paul keating as we remember. so look, australia decides foreign policy in australia and we also decide what questions we\u2019re going to ask ourselves. i do not resile one inch from the fact that i think that this is an issue that the australian government should be able to consider. what i\u2019ve done is put in place a proper process to ensure that we can consider it carefully and make a decision. i\u2019ve said that will be done before christmas and that\u2019s what will be done and i\u2019ve relayed that to our partners in the region. but make no mistake, i\u2019m not going to have our policy dictated by those outside the country. i respect their views, i listen to their views and have in the last few days, but australia determines australian foreign policy. and it seems bill shorten doesn\u2019t seem to quite understand that. journalist: prime minister, agl has just announced that they\u2019re going to offer a safety net for customers, what is your response? prime minister: well, i welcome the fact that agl is going to be dropping the electricity prices on the basis of the discussions that angus taylor has had directly as part of our policy to put the heat on the big electricity companies to reduce electricity prices. angus taylor is the minister for reducing electricity prices, just like tudgey is the minister for busting congestion. and he\u2019s getting results. so, for all of the nay-sayers, for all of those who like to mock the big stick like the labor party does, well, it\u2019s getting results. and that\u2019s what australians measure these things by. our policies are getting results. our economic policies are getting results. unemployment at five per cent. real wage growth in the most recent quarter. female participation in the labour force at record levels. youth unemployment falling, the strongest record of youth jobs performance i n australia\u2019s economic history in the last financial year. our economic plan which involves trade, infrastructure, getting taxes down, backing small business, this is getting results. and our policy on getting electricity prices\u2014as demonstrated by agl\u2019s decision today\u2014is also getting results. so, we\u2019re getting on with it. the liberal national government is getting on with it as we have been for the last five years and we\u2019re getting results. journalist: the new military arrangements with japan, the upgrade in our military relationship with japan. what\u2019s your best guess on when that might actually have some scott morrison ink on it, like the nt deal, when will it be finished? prime minister: well, there\u2019ll be further discussions on that today, tim. there are still some issues we\u2019re working through on that and i look forward to having more discussions on that today. but that said, the tempo and the amount of engagement that we\u2019re having is already lifted and outside of that particular agreement\u2014that was agreed in the last meeting of defence and foreign ministers, the two plus two in sydney just a little while ago. so the tempo and the level of interaction has already increased and that agreement will obviously add to that. but you need to have arrangements right. australia will ensure that we have the arrangement which best protects and services the needs of australia\u2019s defence force personnel in any such arrangement. there are more than 5,000 australians serving here in our defence forces in and around darwin and the territory and they do a fantastic job. we're putting $8 billion into upgrading the defence infrastructure here in and around darwin. that is a huge investment over the next ten years. so the investment here, the investment in the defence forces, the investment in remote indigenous housing and the investment in small businesses here, you can take these opportunities. that's our plan. it\u2019s a plan that that is going to produce a stronger economy here in darwin, here in the territory and across the country. so it\u2019s great to be here today. i commend everybody for their involvement in this project today. i'm very much looking forward to the engagements with prime minister abe today and welcoming him today and having that time of commemoration, but also recognising the investment that has been made in inpex which has had an enormous impact here in the territory and how we can continue to grow and develop that economic and broader partnership. thank you very much. prime minister: well ladies and gentleman, it\u2019s great to be here in one of the world\u2019s great tropical cities, darwin. it\u2019s great to be here in northern australia. it\u2019s great to be here in one of australia\u2019s great cities, darwin. it\u2019s great to be here with the chief minister, the mayor and the leader of the opposition, clp candidates and luke, the local member. it\u2019s great to be here together and particularly with alan tudge, the minister, to be here to announce what is a very big deal for darwin. it\u2019s a very big deal for the territory and it\u2019s a very big deal for australia. it\u2019s a deal that brings together all three levels of government to focus on the future of our most important cities. a city that has been all sorts of history over a long period of time, which we\u2019ll be marking in a very special way a little later today with a visit with prime minister abe. but here, what we\u2019re looking at is the future of this city, to be a leading light for other tropical cities around the world. what we\u2019re announcing today is a cities deal which will see around half a billion dollars invested in its\u2019 future over the next ten years. the commonwealth, together with the territorian government as well as the city council, coming together to invest in projects which will enliven this city. now, from the commonwealth\u2019s point of view, that involves just over $100 million of investments, principally when it comes to charles darwin university to create a vertical campus right here in the middle of the city of darwin, which will bring some 1,100 students into the middle of the city, increasing the vibrancy of the city and bringing future territorians to darwin where they will come and they will study and they will live. the plan is that they will hopefully stay and embrace the wonderful tropical city life of what is darwin. this is a project that will see a great boost, not only in construction works that will take place, but a long-term viable, sustaining, driving force in the heart of the city of darwin. now, on top of that, there will be some important works that we\u2019ve funded, just under $5 million that is looking at the tropical city management process here in darwin. the greening of the city, its\u2019 temperature management, these are challenges which are being faced by tropical cities all around the world. now i have just come from the east asia summit in singapore and the issue of managing these types of issues in tropical cities is one of the biggest challenges being faced by countries in our region today. whether it\u2019s in malaysia or singapore or indonesia or vietnam or other places, one of the key initiatives, the new cities initiative that we are part of in the region, is taking the expertise that we have developed here in australia and exporting that to the world in terms of how you manage and plan and develop cities in tropical locations. so with the csiro we\u2019ll be working here to manage an urban city lab which will be looking at those tropical city management design issues and project issues. i think that\u2019s going to be real boost, not just for the city of darwin to be one of the lead tropical cities in the world, but on top of that it will ensure important export business for services and technology that will further boost the australian economy. in addition to that, we\u2019ve got stokes hill land area just behind us, which will be made available to go through a process to ensure that it can be put to best possible use, particularly working together closely with the larrakia people for whom this is a very important piece of land in the northern te rritory. we work consultatively with them and with the territory government to ensure that\u2019s put to its best and most appropriate use. but also as nigel scullion has been championing, this deal has a jobs guarantee for indigenous australians. a jobs guarantee, to ensure that indigenous people are employed on the projects that go into this deal and it also includes $2 million to support the larrakia people and their economic development here in the territory. so, this is a deal that will make our economy stronger. this is a deal that will make the territory stronger and it\u2019s a deal that i think will improve the living standards and livelihoods of people who live in darwin. not just today, but the many more that we hope will come and live in this tropical city of the future here in darwin. i want to thank again michael gunner the chief minister here, i want to thank kon the mayor, i particularly want to thank alan tudge who has brought this to a conclusion today with our partners. as the minister responsible, i think he\u2019s done an extraordinary job, not just here but many of the other deals we have been able to announce in recent times, so well done alan. and i\u2019m going to pass on to the chief minister and congratulate him again on the win. hon michael gunner, northern territory chief minister: thank you, prime minister. this is an exciting day. today, the australian government, the territory government, darwin city council are investing in darwin as the capital of northern australia. this is an investment that will drive the creation of local jobs here in darwin and in the territory. we will now see more students, more international students call darwin home. we\u2019re now going to see a greener, more tropical darwin. we\u2019ve already started that investment with the creation of extra parkland in the heart of our cbd and the start of cavenagh street shade trial and this will be driven by that csiro living lab. we see darwin as not near asia but in asia. we see darwin as a driver of economic activity and we want, we have a vision for darwin to service our northern neighbours, the wider region. we see our competition as singapore, not sydney. that\u2019s what we want to do and this investment drives and supports that vision. i thank the prime minister, i thank the lord mayor, i thank the vice-chancellor, the minister alan tudge, everybody who\u2019s helped deliver this vision, the larrakia people who have bought into this vision for darwin. this is a very exciting day as we celebrate today the first gas of inpex and that major project, i think it\u2019s perfectly fitting that we celebrate this, another major investment into darwin, the place that we call home and that we love. thank you very much. lord mayor kon vatskalis: well, it is a tropical city as you can see. but this is the deal that will change darwin. we\u2019re not going to be a city in australia, far away from everywhere. we\u2019re going to be the centre between australia and asia. this deal between the federal government and the territory government and the darwin city council is very important for darwin. they\u2019re putting $100 million investment, we\u2019re putting one of the biggest and the only available block in the middle of the city for the university to be placed there. $25 million worth of land that if it was not there, you couldn\u2019t put a university in the middle of the city. a university that will change the face of the city, not only the students but the businesses around that are there now or that will develop to support the university. greening the city, finding solutions for this hot city that is getting hotter. greening the city, putting public art in the streets, in our parks. it is not \u201cwe may think about it,\u201d but now, \u201cit will happen\u201d. it will change darwin as we know it. thank you. minister alan tudge: well, thanks, prime minister. we\u2019ve now signed a number of city deals around the country and each one has a different theme. the most recent one, the geelong city deal, is very much about stimulating the tourism economy. the western sydney city deal is about creating a new city almost, built around the western sydney airport. this one is about really developing the heart and soul of darwin itself to grow it, to make it more liveable and to activate the city centre. as the prime minister said, the central investment from the commonwealth\u2019s perspective is to build a brand new university campus right in the heart of the city and that means you\u2019ll have 11,000 students there on a daily basis, spilling out into the streets, purchasing food at the local cafes and restaurants and enjoying life in darwin and hopefully making it their home forever. it also provides a tremendous opportunity though for international students. i know the vice-chancellor is particularly keen on that university because the northern territory only gets about 0.2 per cent of all international students, despite having about one per cent of the population here. there\u2019s real opportunity for international student growth into this city and that brings people, but it also brings money, because every international student, on average, brings about $44,000 into the local economy, half in fees, the other half in expenditure. so, there\u2019s huge economic potential here as well from this deal. can i just thank the chief minister and the mayor and the mayor and also the vice-chancellor for working so cooperatively together to land this particular deal, but it\u2019s amazing what you can achieve when the three levels of government work cooperatively, honestly, thrash things out together and land something really significant which will shape our city here for the next decade. thank you. prime minister: let\u2019s take some questions on the city deal and as i\u2019ve said before, if there are some other matters, we can deal with those separately. journalist: what evidence is there that bring university students to the city centre will revitalises the economy? prime minister: i\u2019ve seen this firsthand in my own city in liverpool, western sydney university went and put a very large vertical campus there and that is now the biggest training centre for nurses in new south wales. it has completely transformed the city of liverpool and interestingly, because alan just referred to it, one of the reasons the campus was put there in liverpool was because of the investments we\u2019d made in the city deal around the western sydney airport. it all makes sense and so these investments create momentum. they are catalysts and to bring 1,100 people into the centre of darwin, 1,100 in terms of the students, then this will ensure that we are rapidly increasing the money that is churning around in the darwin economy. so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in liverpool in sydney, we\u2019ve seen it in other places around the country and this will be a significant investment. journalist: it\u2019s less money than the money provided for townsville and for the launceston. why is there $100 million for darwin more than for other cities? prime minister: well, every city deal is different and every city deal deals with the projects. i mean, it\u2019s not a league table of investment, what it is it\u2019s a project-based approach. what are the right projects to actually get the city moving in the right direction? the selection of projects that is being done here\u2014we\u2019re doing a series of projects, the territory government is investing in projects like the arts centre and others\u2014and it\u2019s the combination of those projects which is what matters. then the government stepped up with the funding required to make it happen. now, i should stress that on top of what we\u2019ve put in, in terms of our investment in direct funding, there is also the opportunity for further support to be provided through the northern australia infrastructure fund so there is additional opportunity for us to be involved here and that will be a function of those projects as they\u2019re further developed. journalist: malcolm turnbull, when he came to tennant creek a couple of months ago, proposed a regional deal for the barkly region. where are things at with that? prime minister: i\u2019ll be having a bit more to say about that at lunchtime. journalist: why did you block access to your letter offering the gst top-up, which refers to fracking\u2014 prime minister: why don\u2019t we just stay, we\u2019ll stay on the city deal and we can deal with other political issues later. are there other questions to the chief minister and the lord mayor or alan on the issue of the city deal? journalist: what projects are you expecting will be good for regenerating the city stokes hill wharf site? prime minister: well, this has to be consultative process on the stokes hill site and i\u2019m not going to pre-empt that and that consultation. particularly that consultation has to be undertaken with the larrakia people. but i\u2019ll let the chief minister speak on that. chief minister gunner: there are two projects that have been identified as possible for that site amongst others. one is obviously the larrakia cultural centre and there\u2019s investment through the city deal for doing a business case around that. we\u2019ve also flagged around the corner from there, the potential for a water park to be on that site as well. so there\u2019s a couple of projects that may be for that site, that\u2019s not to rule out potential for others to be there as well. obviously, what we\u2019ve done through the c ity deal is agree to work together about clearing those old fuel tanks there and rehabilitating the site and working on that. journalist: just another question for the prime minister. will the federal government commit any funding to revitalise kakadu? prime minister: we\u2019re currently working through that issue. nigel scullion, the senator is working with the territory government and i know gary has written to us as well about some issues with kakadu. but coming out of the tourism industry, i probably know better than most from the southern states how important kakadu is to the northern territory tourism industry. so we\u2019re aware of the issues there and i\u2019ve been working closely with the territory government. today, we\u2019re here talking about darwin and once we\u2019re in a position to say more about those matters, then i will. journalist: why did you block access to your letter of offering the gst to the territory? prime minister: are we done with the city deal, because there will be different people standing at the microphone if we\u2019re going to talk about politics. well, i\u2019m glad to see everybody is excited about the city deal. we\u2019re excited about the city deal as is gary as is kathy and of course, as is jacinta, great to have you here. so, why don\u2019t we thank you very much and of course the vice-chancellor. journalist: later today, you\u2019ll meet with shinzo abe. how does it feel to be the first prime minister to meet with the japanese prime minister since wwii? prime minister: here in darwin? well, i\u2019ve had the opportunity to discuss this with shinzo abe during the recent summit i\u2019ve just been attending in singapore and he\u2019s looking forward to being in darwin. this is going to be a very significant day for darwin with his visit, not just because of the marking of the fact that the first shipment of gas to come out of the inpex project which has been an enormous investment, the single largest investment ever by japan in australia. but it will be, i think, a very sombre time, particularly for australians all around the country, wherever they are, whether they\u2019re in darwin or they\u2019re in other parts of the country and they were here at the time of the raids, or had family members who were killed, over 230 during those raids. i think this is an important time of healing. it\u2019s an important time of reconciliation and for some, i know that will always be difficult, who were directly touched by those events. but what i do know is that the humility of prime minister abe\u2019s attendance here today and the way he has approached similar issues in other parts of the world, says a great deal, not only about his character as a leader and his vision as a leader, but it says a lot about the relationship between japan and australia. we share so much in common in this part of the world and we have a very similar outlook on how issues need to be managed in this part of the world. i\u2019ll be looking forward to discussing those with him further today. obviously, those of you who were up with me in singapore know that those formal discussions have already commenced and we\u2019ll have a lot more today. i\u2019m very much looking forward to welcoming him here today and i think it will be an important visit, not just for darwin, but for australia. journalist: pm, could you speak to the strategic implications of what you and prime minister abe will be signing today, with the view to the region, with a view to the tensions between china and the us which we saw writ large in singapore? prime minister: we both have a very similar outlook when it comes to managing our relationships with two important partners. japan has a very important strategic partnership with the united states, as do we. they also have a very significant trade relationship with china and a broader relationship, as do we. so i think in getting together and talking about the many tense issues that exist in managing both of those relationships, i think it\u2019s a very positive way of taking all of our relationships forward. we\u2019re basically dealing with the same set of issues. so to round that out, whether it\u2019s on defence issues, whether it\u2019s on trade issues, we are working very closely together and identifying more and more ways to do that. the defence and foreign ministers met in sydney recently and that further implemented a whole range of more cooperative activity in terms of joint activities and exercises and that\u2019s been continuing. we\u2019re very keen to see how that can be progressed to the future and we\u2019ll have more to discuss on that topic today. but the trade issues around rcep and the potential additional participants in the tpp which prime minister abe was instrumental in ensuring that that deal came together along with our former prime minister, mr turnbull and the former prime minister of new zealand, john key. so prime minister abe i know, sort of carries a great deal of ownership of that arrangement and his intention as is ours is to see others join that relationship in the future. journalist: [inaudible] right to be concerned that chinese investment could affect australian democracy, openness and transparency, perhaps in this country but maybe also in the region? prime minister: no, i don\u2019t share that view. journalist: prime minister, do you expect this will be an awkward or uncomfortable visit of the japanese leader, having had the chance to speak with him? prime minister: no, i don\u2019t. because he has undertaken similar visits around the world in similar locations with similar history and he approaches this with an authenticity and a humility which comes very naturally to him. i think that will greatly assist in putting at ease some of the very deep feelings that are around this issue, so i think he\u2019s demonstrated very well and in a very positive way at how these visits can actually take the issue forward, provide a moment of reflection and healing and continue to reinforce the relationship in very positive terms. journalist: why did you block access to, basically, your never offering gst top-up to the northern territory, that refer to the lifting of the moratorium? because the australia institute has basically alleged- prime minister: the australia institute? oh, the australia institute, that well-known, independent think-tank. okay. journalist: they are an environmental think-tank. prime minister: they\u2019re a left-wing think-tank, so let\u2019s not say they don\u2019t have any partisan bias. okay, next. journalist: okay, is that why you refused access? prime minister: no. journalist: so if i applied, would you give me the letter? prime minister: no. the gst issue in the northern territory and the decision of the northern territory government in relation to gas were unrelated. i\u2019ve said that, the northern territory government said that. they\u2019ve made their decision, we made our decision. i applaud their decision, i did at the time. more than $250 million has been put in top-ups to the northern territory government and that\u2019s to ensure that they can meet their obligations here to essential services in the territory. this has been a significant investment by our government. we understand the needs of territorians and that\u2019s why we were so quick to provide that support and that will be backed up by another $69 million. so the northern territory government for that, $500 million for remote indigenous housing over the next five years. this is another part of the important partnership so our government is investing heavily, heavily in the territory because of the unique challenges that are faced here. i mean, we\u2019ve talked about the $100 million and more going into the city deal today. but that comes on top of $100 million we\u2019ve already put into road infrastructure and congestion management projects here in darwin already. so, we\u2019re doing a lot of investment here in the north. journalist: is it appropriate to invite japanese families to grieve in darwin in the same place the australians gathered will? prime minister: we\u2019ll continue to work sensibly through those issues. journalist: mr morrison, you said that the nsc will have a role in reviewing the israel embassy shift, whether they\u2019re doing it or not. will they take into account the views of dr mahathir about raising the terrorist risk? prime minister: australia sets foreign policy in australia, nobody else. journalist: and what did you make of josh frydenberg\u2019s comments on radio this morning? he\u2019s saying that dr mahathir comments should be taken with a grain of salt. prime minister: well, dr mahathir i had the opportunity to meet with yesterday. he raised these issues, i must say, quite courteously, at the end of the meeting. that was not only expected, he raised them and i think what josh said today was basically a bit of filling in the history of his record on various issues over time. i think those issues are well-known and his contributions to the public record on these topics are well-known, they go back a long way through many, many prime ministers, going back to paul keating as we remember. so look, australia decides foreign policy in australia and we also decide what questions we\u2019re going to ask ourselves. i do not resile one inch from the fact that i think that this is an issue that the australian government should be able to consider. what i\u2019ve done is put in place a proper process to ensure that we can consider it carefully and make a decision. i\u2019ve said that will be done before christmas and that\u2019s what will be done and i\u2019ve relayed that to our partners in the region. but make no mistake, i\u2019m not going to have our policy dictated by those outside the country. i respect their views, i listen to their views and have in the last few days, but australia determines australian foreign policy. and it seems bill shorten doesn\u2019t seem to quite understand that. journalist: prime minister, agl has just announced that they\u2019re going to offer a safety net for customers, what is your response? prime minister: well, i welcome the fact that agl is going to be dropping the electricity prices on the basis of the discussions that angus taylor has had directly as part of our policy to put the heat on the big electricity companies to reduce electricity prices. angus taylor is the minister for reducing electricity prices, just like tudgey is the minister for busting congestion. and he\u2019s getting results. so, for all of the nay-sayers, for all of those who like to mock the big stick like the labor party does, well, it\u2019s getting results. and that\u2019s what australians measure these things by. our policies are getting results. our economic policies are getting results. unemployment at five per cent. real wage growth in the most recent quarter. female participation in the labour force at record levels. youth unemployment falling, the strongest record of youth jobs performance i n australia\u2019s economic history in the last financial year. our economic plan which involves trade, infrastructure, getting taxes down, backing small business, this is getting results. and our policy on getting electricity prices\u2014as demonstrated by agl\u2019s decision today\u2014is also getting results. so, we\u2019re getting on with it. the liberal national government is getting on with it as we have been for the last five years and we\u2019re getting results. journalist: the new military arrangements with japan, the upgrade in our military relationship with japan. what\u2019s your best guess on when that might actually have some scott morrison ink on it, like the nt deal, when will it be finished? prime minister: well, there\u2019ll be further discussions on that today, tim. there are still some issues we\u2019re working through on that and i look forward to having more discussions on that today. but that said, the tempo and the amount of engagement that we\u2019re having is already lifted and outside of that particular agreement\u2014that was agreed in the last meeting of defence and foreign ministers, the two plus two in sydney just a little while ago. so the tempo and the level of interaction has already increased and that agreement will obviously add to that. but you need to have arrangements right. australia will ensure that we have the arrangement which best protects and services the needs of australia\u2019s defence force personnel in any such arrangement. there are more than 5,000 australians serving here in our defence forces in and around darwin and the territory and they do a fantastic job. we're putting $8 billion into upgrading the defence infrastructure here in and around darwin. that is a huge investment over the next ten years. so the investment here, the investment in the defence forces, the investment in remote indigenous housing and the investment in small businesses here, you can take these opportunities. that's our plan. it\u2019s a plan that that is going to produce a stronger economy here in darwin, here in the territory and across the country. so it\u2019s great to be here today. i commend everybody for their involvement in this project today. i'm very much looking forward to the engagements with prime minister abe today and welcoming him today and having that time of commemoration, but also recognising the investment that has been made in inpex which has had an enormous impact here in the territory and how we can continue to grow and develop that economic and broader partnership. thank you very much.

oliver peterson: i\u2019m fantastic. what have you been doing over this side of the country today? alan tudge: well, this is the first time i\u2019ve been in perth since i\u2019ve assumed these new portfolio responsibilities and largely it\u2019s been a listening exercise to understand some people\u2019s concerns around population, around traffic congestion and where the hot spots are, and also talking about some of our infrastructure expenditure which we\u2019ve got going on. so, at the moment i\u2019m on the road heading out to mandurah to catch up with andrew hastie and he\u2019s got some particular projects which he wants to show me out there as well. oliver peterson: alright. i actually saw a little video of yourself and christian porter on social media accounts today talking about a freeway upgrade and asking the state government to come to the party. alan tudge: yeah, well this is the mitchell freeway extension, so it would extend it up to romeo road, which is a really important extension because there\u2019s so much growth up in that corridor. and the frustrating thing is both- we actually had an agreement with the state government to each contribute $107 million and we signed that, we jointly announced that back in april. the state\u2019s actually, though, reneged on that and now wants us to cough up a lot more money and we\u2019re a bit frustrated by that, so we\u2019re calling on the state government just to honour the commitment so that we can get that extension done. oliver peterson: you\u2019re hoping they match your commitment of $107 million - surely with an extra $4.7 billion with the gst now flowing to western australia after your senate colleagues passed that today, they might be able to find the money. alan tudge: well, exactly. and i should point out: it\u2019s a really exciting day for western australia because that gst deal passed the senate just today and that does mean $4.7 billion extra going into western australia. so, there is the money there for the infrastructure projects. and on this particular one, ollie, it\u2019s- normally you have a bit of argy bargy when you\u2019re negotiating these projects, but on this occasion we actually had an agreement struck that we\u2019d each pay 50-50 for the mitchell freeway extension, we announced that - there\u2019s a joint media release which has gone out in relation to it. but now the state government has pulled back and said: no, no - we actually want the federal government to pay 80 per cent and we\u2019ll just pay 20. we just want them to live up to the initial agreement struck so that we can get on and build that freeway extension. oliver peterson: well, before you joined us, minister, we were actually asking all of our listeners this afternoon to tell us why they deserved to be recognised as the person or the particular group of people who were able to fix wa\u2019s share of the gst, because all of your colleagues right across the political divide today have claimed it is all down to them. alan tudge - is it down to you? are you the reason why wa\u2019s now got a greater share of the gst? alan tudge: [laughs] no, no. i can\u2019t claim the credit on this one, ollie. oliver peterson: you\u2019d be the only person who isn\u2019t claiming credit, minister. alan tudge: i must admit that all of my federal liberal colleagues were absolutely determined on this and every time that we got together in canberra in parliament house, this would be the number one issue that ken wyatt and steve irons and christian porter and andrew hastie would be raising, as well as the other colleagues there. so, we are glad that we\u2019ve been able to fix it and it\u2019s not at the expense of any of the other states - we\u2019ve found new money, and in part we can find new money because the economy\u2019s growing strongly, but it does mean more money for western australia to fix up what was an unfair situation beforehand. oliver peterson: and speaking of your colleagues here in wa, how do you think this will now help your liberal colleagues and their re-election chances when we do go to a federal poll next year? alan tudge: oh, this was all about just making the gst formula fairer, to be honest. i mean, when western australia got down to 30 cents in the dollar, clearly that wasn\u2019t a fair and reasonable proposition. i mean, i used to- every time i came over to western australia before we\u2019d signed this agreement, i mean, every single person on the street would be raising it with me, not just my parliamentary colleagues. so it was an important issue, it was unfair and we\u2019ve now fixed that, and it does enable western australia therefore to power ahead, to continue to build the infrastructure which is required, and we\u2019ll continue to support those infrastructure efforts as well with dedicated dollars. oliver peterson: now, alan tudge, you are the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, and i know that what you\u2019re working on at the moment in lots of conversations you\u2019re having right around the country is in regards to australia\u2019s population and there has been some discussion around potentially giving the states a little bit more power in regards to particularly skilled migrant numbers. is this something you\u2019re prepared to negotiate with all the different various state and territory governments? alan tudge: yeah, this is something which we\u2019ve flagged that we want to examine further and discuss further with the state governments because at the moment, ollie, as you can probably understand, we at the federal level control the most important population growth lever, and that is migration, and that accounts for about 60 per cent of australia\u2019s population growth. at the same time, the states are largely responsible for developing the infrastructure and the schools and the hospitals et cetera to cater for that population growth. and we want a closer relationship there and that involves asking the states to bear more considered views as to what their population growth numbers, driven by migration should be. so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve indicated, to have a much more bottom up approach to migration if you like, rather than us setting the top line number and then pushing it down to the states for them to cope with. and i think if we get a closer alignment between the migration numbers set at the federal level and the infrastructure plans developed at the state level, then we\u2019ll get greater liveability of our cities. oliver peterson: yeah. and that\u2019s something you and i have discussed before minister in regards to the population growth you\u2019ve experienced there, particularly in melbourne and sydney versus the challenges we face here in perth. because at the moment, we\u2019re not booming as much as sydney and melbourne are, so we need to find a way to bring more people here and there\u2019d be more jobs for them to obviously work in and hopefully, we start to see our own house prices start to move in the positive direction once again. alan tudge: in the positive direction. yes, a very different situation here in perth compared to the eastern cities. in the eastern cities you\u2019ve got, particularly in melbourne and sydney, absolutely booming from the population perspective. i mean, melbourne grew by 2.7 per cent last year which was about 125,000 people added. now that\u2019s one of the fastest growing cities in the english speaking world. whereas here in perth, you grew by about 20,000 people which is about 0.9 per cent growth.  so some of the discussions i\u2019ve been having even today \u2013 how can we support stronger growth here in perth, including using migration as a lever in a strategic and targeted manner, where the jobs are available? there certainly are in some of the regional locations and some of the mayors have been speaking to me saying that they can\u2019t get workers, so please help us. and so we\u2019re obviously working closely with them to support their ambitions. but where there are good plans there and there\u2019s jobs which are there to be had and we want to support those businesses too, to be able to find people to fill those jobs. oliver peterson: absolutely. alan tudge, i\u2019ll let you get on with your afternoon. enjoy your function with andrew hastie. thanks for your time. alan tudge: thanks very much ollie. oliver peterson: that\u2019s the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, alan tudge.

[excerpt] alan tudge: so, i had a good series of meetings today, but perhaps the two most important were a population discussion with a bunch of different stakeholders from planners from councils to developers to academics and other stakeholders. there we were largely discussing the population aspirations of tasmania and how we can better plan to adapt and cater for those population aspirations. and the second- sorry, go on. gary magnussen: [interrupts] alright, so just on population, then - are you looking to continue with the prime minister\u2019s plan to use visas to increase tasmania\u2019s population? alan tudge: well, what we want to do is have a considered population strategy for the country, and that has to be bottom up as much as it is top down. and what we mean by that is that we want to understand what the population plans are for each state and territory - do they have the services in place to cater for those population plans, and then we can then join with them and support those plans. that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. gary magnussen: okay, so anything on that is a way off yet? alan tudge: oh listen, we\u2019re working on this at the moment and going through a consultation process, but one of the key things which we\u2019ve got happening in the country as a whole is we\u2019ve got quite fast population growth nationally, but it\u2019s very concentrated in some particular areas when there\u2019s other areas that actually want to grow faster and need more people. now, some regional areas in australia need more people; some of the smaller cities want to grow faster. in tasmania, you\u2019ve got quite slow growth, and sometimes negative growth, in areas outside of hobart and so there is that challenge of how can you support the growth - the economic growth and the population growth - of those areas whilst you\u2019re dealing with the population pressures of a relatively fast-growing city like hobart now. gary magnussen: okay. now, let\u2019s talk about the hobart city deal, which is on the table. what came out of your meeting there today? alan tudge: sorry - you just broke up when you were asking the question. gary magnussen: what came out of your hobart city deal meeting today? alan tudge: so today we had a meeting of myself; peter gutwein, the state treasurer; plus the four mayors who are involved in the city deal. and we were really going through the next level of detail with those participants and our ambition is to finalise this city deal by the end of the year, if we can. we went through some of the broad architecture of it and the fact that we now need to go and consult with the various councils, because we\u2019ve got four [indistinct] finalise the details by the end of the year. gary magnussen: well, one of the mayors is dead against a plan to move the antarctic division from kingston to the city, into an antarctic precinct at macquarie point. is that plan still on the table? alan tudge: oh, well the plan to create an antarctic and scientific precinct at macquarie point is still on the table and we wanted to- in part we have to do that because when the new ice breaker comes in, as soon as we can build a ship, that will need a new port, so that can go at macquarie point around the corner. there\u2019s also the opportunity to potentially move the quarantine station across there as well and look at other opportunities to create that precinct. it doesn\u2019t have to involve kingston at all. personally, i haven\u2019t been convinced that the case has been made yet for that. if any people do move at all, though, out of there, peter gutwein the treasurer today made the commitment that there would be no net loss of jobs for the kingston area, which i think was an important commitment made. gary magnussen: okay. well, moving on to another big part of the city deal that people are interested in, and that is light rail. are you giving a commitment on that, because it seems that the prime minister was wavering? alan tudge: oh, the single biggest commitment which we\u2019ve already announced has been the $461 million commitment to the bridgewater bridge, and above and beyond that the details will be finalised over the months ahead. but i guess the key thing is that this city deal which we will announce hopefully in the next month or two won\u2019t be- it\u2019s not a christmas stocking, if you like. the most important part of it actually is setting up a governance structure so that we can plan better across the three levels of government; that\u2019s the key part of it. and then of course there\u2019ll be a number of initiatives underpinning that. but the most important thing is this is going to be a ten year plan for greater hobart across the three levels of government, and that hasn\u2019t been done before and that\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting about this city deal. gary magnussen: but with respect, the bridgewater bridge has already been announced and that\u2019s- i find that very interesting that you\u2019re now winding that into the city deal. alan tudge: no, it has been announced and when it was announced it was said right at the get-go that this was going to be a part of the city deal. gary magnussen: okay, okay. look, let\u2019s just go back to light rail - so, you didn\u2019t really answer that. so, are you committed to light rail? alan tudge: i can\u2019t tell you what the other commitments in the city deal will be at this particular stage; we haven\u2019t finalised it yet but we do hope to finalise it by the end of the year. gary magnussen: alan tudge, thanks very much for your time this afternoon. alan tudge: thanks very much.

"], "smart-cities-through-smart-planning": ["30 October 2018", "thank you for the opportunity to speak at smart cities conference. i'd like to start by acknowledging adam beck, the executive director of the smart cities council, les walker the deputy mayor from the townsville city council, as well as dignitaries from the asean region and new zealand who have joined us here today. it is great to be here this morning in australia's largest capital city. sydney provides a great example of the challenges associated with rapid population growth\u2014and also\u2014an example of the good outcomes and benefits that can be achieved when all levels of government work together to properly plan and grow our cities. through this conference, you will have heard a lot about what it takes to have a \u2018smart city\u2019. technology is, of course, one aspect and i will touch on this. but i want to focus my remarks on another aspect of having a smart city: smart planning. at both a national and city level. because if you don't have good planning, then it doesn't matter how much technology you have, cities will become less liveable. and ultimately, it is productive, prosperous and liveable cities that we are after. i would like to take you through some of the challenges we have due to our federal structure\u2014when one level of government controls the major population growth lever, while the other is responsible for infrastructure and service delivery\u2014and how we might ameliorate some of these challenges. let me start with some facts. australia is growing very rapidly; among the fastest in the developed world. we grew by 3.75\u00a0million in the last decade, which is nearly twice as many as in the previous decade. as an immigrant nation, we have had periods of rapid growth since european settlement, but our current growth rate has only been surpassed by a brief period in the 1920s and during the \u201cpopulate or perish\u201d period immediately following world war ii. of course, in raw numbers of people, our growth has never been higher. our nation is adding the equivalent of a city the size of canberra every year and the size of adelaide every 3.5 years. this growth would be challenging enough to manage with adequate infrastructure and services, but there are two additional factors that make it even more challenging. first, the growth is not evenly distributed. rather, 75 per cent of the growth has been to the three large urban areas\u2014melbourne, sydney and south east queensland\u2014while the rest of the country has had very modest growth. hence, on a city basis, melbourne has been growing by 2.7 per cent, sydney by 2.1 per cent and south east queensland by 2.3 per cent. this is very rapid growth by any standard. among the english speaking world, only three cities grew faster than melbourne in absolute numbers: houston, dallas and atlanta. second, the growth is well above what was forecast. for example, the 2002 intergenerational report predicted australia would grow by about 2.5\u00a0million people over the next 15 years. we actually grew by 5\u00a0million. melbourne was predicted by the australian bureau of statistics to grow by 500,000 from 2004 until 2107. it grew by 1.2\u00a0million. the single biggest contributor to the growth that i have described is international migration. it accounts for 60 per cent of all growth, but 65 per cent of melbourne's growth and 83 per cent of sydney's. the rest is made up of natural increases (with internal migration a factor in terms of the growth of particular locations within australia). how did we, as a nation, get the forecasts so wrong? our birth rate and life expectancy were slightly above forecasts, but the main reason was that prime minister rudd in 2007 almost doubled the immigration intake, without any forewarning. this put the population growth onto a new, unplanned trajectory. and we are still catching up on this. the data shows that while infrastructure expenditure largely matches the population increase, there is a lag. the problem is that through the migration lever, the federal government largely determines the population growth which then drives the demand for housing, roads, rail and other infrastructure and services. but then it is the state's responsibility to provide the supply of those things. as i mentioned, this is a challenging but manageable problem when the population growth is predictable, but is particularly hard when demand rapidly increases without warning. the congestion problems in sydney (which we are now just getting on top of) are the result of this mismatch from past years. on the one hand, we had premier carr saying that sydney was full and was consequently not building for the future, as dr liz allen of anu has noted. but then, just a few years later, prime minster rudd turbocharged the population growth. state and federal policies were working in opposite directions. thanks to a huge infrastructure investment, supported by the coalition government, sydney is now getting on top of this problem. in a couple of years' time, when the major works are completed, sydney's roads and rail will be much better again. but it has meant years of unnecessarily high rates of congestion. so how do we learn from the past and address this structural problem? we need to put in place a better planning framework that better aligns population ambitions with infrastructure and service delivery. our population plans need to be more bottom up\u2014state by state, and region by region\u2014as much as they are top down. we then need to put in place the migration settings to support those plans. some states, like south australia, for example want 15,000 more people each year. some regions, like south western victoria, cannot get enough people to fill the available jobs. there are an estimated 46,000 vacancies in regional australia today, according to the regional australia institute. of course, we need to continue to invest record amounts in infrastructure in the process. the other important part to this is the city deals. each city deal is unique, but they have the capacity to do much smarter planning at the local or regional level involving all three levels of government. the best example of this is the western sydney city deal. this is a partnership between the australian, nsw and eight local governments to deliver rail, jobs and community infrastructure for the people of western sydney. the city deal builds on the unique opportunity of the western sydney airport\u2014a $5.3\u00a0billion commonwealth investment\u2014to catalyse the new \u2018aerotropolis\u2019 to attract investment, increase job diversity and ensure access to opportunities right across western sydney. there are 38 city deal commitments across six key themes that will be delivered by the australian and nsw governments together with the eight local councils that make up the \u2018western parkland city\u2019. already we are seeing the benefits of our investment and vision for western sydney, with recent announcements that two of japan's biggest multinational companies have committed to the region. the commitment by mitsubishi heavy industries and sumitome mitsui financial group demonstrates how smart planning attracts smart investment. there is no doubt the western parkland city is developing into a smart city as a direct result of smart planning between governments. the airport itself will be a \u2018smart airport\u2019 with the most up to date technology built into it from the beginning. smarter planning is the best way the federal government can lead in the creation of smarter cities. but there are other ways too. let me mention two\u2014both of which have a technology focus. the first is to support smarter road and transport systems. we are investing a record $75\u00a0billion into infrastructure, but if we can get better utilisation of infrastructure, we can achieve better congestion-alleviation for the money invested. my home town of melbourne has been one of the leaders in using technology to achieve this through smart technology like variable speed signs, ramp signals, travel time signs, underground sensors and cctv cameras. they are all part of a dynamic traffic system that is responding in real time to what's happening on the road at any point in time. this has resulted in capacity improvements of 19% and combined safety and efficiency performance improvements of 50%. the federal government has supported some of this managed motorways technology, including as part of the tullamarine freeway widening which has recently been completed, as well as other projects. we are also endeavouring to be ready for, and help shape, the challenges and opportunities that will come from driverless vehicles. this also has the potential for another step change increase in capacity utilisation of existing road, rail and other transport assets. technology is changing rapidly and there are a range of predictions about how quickly we are going to see a take up of driverless vehicles. transposition has undertaken modelling which suggests that saturation of highly automated vehicles in the australian fleet could occur roughly between 2050 and 2060. at the other end of the spectrum, in 2016, telstra's chief technology officer predicted that by 2030 all cars could be driverless. the federal government is taking a strategic leadership role to coordinate more cohesively with other governments and agencies to implement future transport technologies in australia. an office of future transport technologies has been established within my department to enable the australian government to work with industry and state and territory governments to ensure australia is ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead. the opportunities for driverless and/or on-demand public transport services are particularly exciting. it will lead to greater efficiency, more convenience for the public, and a blending of the definitions of public and private transport. the new south wales government is currently trialing an on demand bus service. on demand is a flexible alternative public transport service, which allows people to book a vehicle via an online app or over the phone, from their home or a nearby location such as a shopping centre or hospital, taking them to a local transport hub or landmark. the cost is comparable to a one-way bus ticket and it allows people to access public transport when and where they need it, improving connectivity to the existing public transport network. this trial is an example of smart planning, applying technology in an innovative way to transform existing services not only making it more efficient for government but also providing better services for the community. the second way that the federal government can support cities becoming \u201csmarter\u201d by using technology is through the funding of innovative projects that if successful, can be replicated elsewhere. we have done this through our $50\u00a0million smart cities and suburbs program. it encourages innovative technology-based approaches that improve the livability of cities and regional centres across australia. we have already done the first round and soon, i will be announcing the successful applicants for the second round. some of the successful projects from round 1 included: cities are the most important social and economic structures in australia. we are lucky to have vibrant, well connected cities and regional centres that rate highly amongst the most liveable cities in the world. we need to maintain the liveability of our cities. we need to continue to make them more productive as they are an engine of wealth creation. this can be greatly assisted through technology and data analytics, but developing more sophisticated planning frameworks remains critical.

[indistinct] you\u2019ve got \u00a0young people throughout the day, who are purchasing things, doing the caf\u00e9s. they\u2019re bringing life to the city centre and that\u2019s what [indistinct] is. adam steer: you\u2019re on abc radio darwin. adam steer with you this, morning. you\u2019re also hearing from the federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population alan tudge. minister, just get you to hold there for a second. graham has called in from leanyer. g\u2019day graham, what\u2019s your thoughts? hello, graham. you there? caller graham: yeah, mate. yep, i\u2019m here. adam steer: yep. caller graham: adam, look, i\u2019ve been listening to the minister\u2019s talk and it reminds me very much of the issue we had with tiger brennan in the howard era; and all i can i say is that we must be about almost six months away from an election and this is being held up as a carrot. adam steer: that\u2019s a good point. thank you, graham. alan tudge, is graham right? waiting for a cash splash in the lead up to the next election? alan tudge: no. so this has been under the [inaudible] and as you pointed out for over a year. now\u2026 adam steer: [talks over] a year and a half. alan tudge: we\u2019ve been through this \u2013 it is a lot of money that we\u2019re talking about and we want to get the deal done and we\u2019re getting very close to doing so. adam steer: the territory is losing population and business down south. instead of waiting for the right political opportunity, why not give territorians some confidence by signing it now? alan tudge: it\u2019s going to be signed very soon, adam, and i think that territorians will be pleased with the outcome. adam steer: in other news, you\u2019ve just announced a migrant plan which will require new migrants to live in regional areas for five years after arriving in australia, forcing them to live outside the big capitals to reduce urban congestion and boost regional economies. how many migrants can we expect to be redirected to the northern territory? alan tudge: listen, in part, that might depend on what the northern territory government\u2019s population plans are. now, i know that chief minister gunner does want to grow the northern territory and if he\u2019s got good growth plans and has the jobs to accommodate the migrants, then we will obviously work closely with him to try to meet those objectives. one of the real challenges that we\u2019ve got is we\u2019ve got tremendous growth in the big capital cities of melbourne, sydney, and brisbane but very anaemic growth elsewhere around the country, and if we can just get a better distribution of that growth, take a bit of pressure off those big cities, then we can also support the ambitions of the territory, of south australia, of western australia and tasmania so that they can grow as well. adam steer: i mean one of the big problems or challenges that you face is how you can make sure that any migrants that you force to live in those regional areas stay there. so for example, in the territory, they can- how are you going to make sure that they don\u2019t stay in the territory instead of just ticking a box and saying: yep, i\u2019ve lived there, and then they move to either melbourne or sydney? alan tudge:\u00a0yeah, let me say a couple of points on that. firstly, no one\u2019s being forced to go anywhere. we\u2019re talking about people coming into the country in the future and people making a choice to go and live in a smaller city or a regional area and they might be provided with some incentives in order to make that choice. the second thing though is that we might put a condition upon that visa for several years. now, we put conditions upon visas all the time including geographic conditions and by and large people abide by them. in fact there\u2019s only about a 0.2 per cent default on conditional visas. so there\u2019s a system already in place, it works and what i\u2019ve been suggesting is that we could offer more incentives for people to go to some of the smaller cities and [inaudible] forms of conditions so that people hopefully make those smaller cities or the regions their home because they\u2019re there for a few years, they get a job, the kids are going to school and they make it their life destination. adam steer: what skill shortages are you aware these migrants might be able to fill in the northern territory? alan tudge:\u00a0i haven\u2019t had a good look at the skill shortages for the northern territory yet. it\u2019s something that would be negotiated with the northern territory government. we already do that pretty well actually through what\u2019s called the destination area migration agreement where in essence you do sit down with the government leaders, the business leaders, and work out exactly what the skill shortages are. because the northern territory group does have some quite unique ones which are separate to the rest of the country and that is why we do have that special agreement with the northern territory and we intend to update that. adam steer: alan tudge, good to talk to you this morning. the prime minister as i said will be coming up here in about a month\u2019s time. are you planning to come up to the top end any time soon? alan tudge: the last time i was up there was probably a couple of months ago. i\u2019d like to get up there again soon to discuss and talk about the implementation of this city deal and not just to sign it. i haven\u2019t got any plans over the next few weeks but i\u2019d like to get up there before the end of the year if i can. adam steer: and just to confirm the city\u2019s deal will be signed very soon you\u2019re saying? alan tudge: very soon. very soon it\u2019s going to be signed. certainly this year. and as i said it\u2019s a very significant amount of money which goes into darwin to revitalise the city centre and i think that territorians will warmly welcome it. adam steer: and that will be $100 million? alan tudge: well, that was the commitment of the northern territory. [indistinct] these things are done on a sharing basis. adam steer: so that will be signed our announced? alan tudge: it will be both signed and announced this year. adam steer: minister, good to hear from you this morning. appreciate your time. alan tudge: fantastic adam, thanks very much. adam steer: there\u2019s alan tudge. he\u2019s the latest federal minister for cities urban infrastructure and population.

"], "abc-730-interview-leigh-sales": ["17 October 2018", "leigh sales:\u00a0 and joining me now is the population minister, alan tudge. minister, is it a bit of a pipedream as we heard in that story, to suddenly think you can put up migrant-proof fences and keep people in regions? alan tudge:\u00a0no-one's talking about putting up migrant-proof fences, leigh, what we're saying is that we can create further incentives and indeed some conditions for people to go to some of the smaller cities or some of the regions. and what you'll find is once people are there and they've got a job there and their kids are going to school there, they're likely to stay there and make it their home. leigh sales: so what are the carrots and what are the sticks? alan tudge:\u00a0oh well we've already got some things in place. now, for example, the 489 visa does provide incentives for people to go to a smaller state or to a region and the condition is that you must be there for a couple of years. and what we find is that people abide by their conditions. in fact, only about 0.2% of people breach that condition. so it's not a radical idea, we already do this on a relatively small scale today. what i've been suggesting as part of our broader plans is one thing we can do is provide further incentives for new migrants to go to the regional areas\u2026 leigh sales: [interrupts] like what? alan tudge:\u00a0\u2026or indeed to a smaller city. so, for example, you can look at things like providing additional points through the points-based skilled migration system. that's where if you're coming to australia accumulating points and get into the country, you might get additional points for example, if you choose to go to adelaide, rather than come to melbourne or sydney. leigh sales: [interrupts] yeah, but how do you police that? alan tudge: they're the types of things we can- but we already have mechanisms to do that. so again, this is not a radical idea and many people have commented on this. we have mechanisms already in place to do this because some of our visas already have conditions to say that you must stay in a regional area or a smaller city. now, that's just as simple, it really is as saying that have you got documents to suggest that you have been based in that particular smaller city rather than in melbourne or sydney? it could be your school reports, it could be your electricity bill, it could be those types of ordinary documents which show where you live. leigh sales:\u00a0how many migrants should be allowed into australia every year? alan tudge: well we set a cap each year as you probably know. last year was in fact, about 162,000 people became permanent migrants and that was the lowest level in a decade. you have temporary migration on top of that and we'll expect that to come down over the next few years. leigh sales: and is that about where you think the numbers should be? alan tudge: we evaluate that every year as part of the budget context. but one of the things i have foreshadowed is we actually do need a better population planning mechanism, whereby we better marry the population ambitions of the cities and the regions with the infrastructure and services. because one of the features of our federation is that we have the main population levers\u2014be it migration and other levers\u2014yet the states are largely responsible for the infrastructure and for the services on the ground.  we need to better match those things so that we can control the population growth and that's been my overall message. leigh sales: well on that point, as we've heard over the past three nights from people in brisbane, melbourne and sydney, there are constant complaints about overcrowding, about congestion, about housing. why shouldn't the federal government put a pause on immigration so the states can catch up with infrastructure? alan tudge: because in essence there's two issues going on here rather than one. the first issue is indeed that our three big cities are growing very fast. melbourne is growing the fastest at 2.7 per cent per annum, sydney by 2.1, south east queensland by about 2.3 per cent; fast by international standards. on the other hand the second problem though, is you have some regions and some smaller states who are crying out for more people. indeed the regional institute of australia reported this week that there are 47,000 vacancies in the regions alone as we speak. so if we can just ease the pressure on the big cities, and enable the further growth in those jobs to be filled in the regions, then we actually achieve two objectives rather than one. leigh sales: but as we heard in that story, we've been trying for 100 yours to decentralise australia. you yourself say that the program you're wanting to extend has been in place for a while and it hasn't worked. alan tudge: oh well, i think it has worked, but it's been on a relatively small scale. leigh sales: if you talk to people in sydney, melbourne and brisbane, they wouldn't agree with you? alan tudge: but it's been on a relatively small scale and i suppose what i'm saying is that i understand the pressures which people in melbourne, sydney and brisbane feel. i mean, i live in melbourne, 35 kilometres out from the city in the outer eastern suburbs and people absolutely feel the congestion pressures there. so we understand that. and one of the things which we want to do is ease the congestion pressures on the big cities, but at the same time support the aspirations for growth in adelaide where the premier\u2014i have spoken to him\u2014wants to grow that city by another 15,000 to 20,000 people each year. same with the chief minister of the northern territory. same with the premier of tasmania. same with the premier of western australia. so we can, i think achieve the two birds, we can achieve the two objectives at the same time. leigh sales: minister alan tudge, thank you very much for joining us this evening. alan tudge: thanks very much leigh. "], "sky-news-live-credlin-interview-peta-credlin": ["16 October 2018", "peta credlin: well, the issue of immigration has been front of mind for many australians in recent years as congestion in our city builds up, housing becomes harder to afford, and population pressures create challenges for the integration of migrants into our local communities, particularly in states like victoria. we've seen the rise of african gangs and violent behaviour in places like melbourne that have sparked calls for a national debate on the issue of integration, but it's been an issue that most politicians\u2014left and right\u2014have wanted to shut down. now, at the start of this year, tony abbott took immigration head on in a speech in february. you will remember at the time he was heavily criticised by the then-prime minister malcolm turnbull, but he picked up considerable support in the community from people who feel politicians are not listening to them and who want to see a sober and thoughtful debate on the size of australia's population\u2014how we manage the intake, the services we need, where people will live, what sort of jobs are available; the sort of policy work, to be honest, that governments should be doing, but they're not. following abbott's comments, new south wales opposition leader luke foley argued for a cut in migrants to sydney until their infrastructure can catch up. former new south wales premier bob carr backed this too, and in recent weeks new south wales premier gladys berejiklian has come down in support of a slow down to migrants to sydney. now, at a federal level, which is where these sorts of policies about migrant intake are actually decided, well, both sides of politics seem reluctant to deal with the issue head on. in august, australia's population hit 25\u00a0million\u201422 years earlier than previous forecasts said it would\u2014and it shows, as a nation, we're under population pressure. we are taking some of the largest migrants into australia in our history and some of these intake, the level of these intakes are world records. so where to now? well, a lot's been said by the new minister for cities and population alan tudge, with an announcement last week about working to ensure new migrants relocate to regional and rural areas rather than our overpopulated capital cities. it all sounds absolutely fantastic\u2014great speech by the minister\u2014but i'm interested now in the detail and he joins me now from canberra, alan tudge. thanks for your time\u2014great to have you back from that division; glad you got there on time. alan tudge: thanks, peta. peta credlin: good that you're fit. alan tudge: i got there on time; it wasn't an important division, it was one moved i think by the greens or the independents, so it was quick in and out and back here. peta credlin: oh, you never know. you don't want to be the bloke that misses it and it's something, you know, that's absolutely essential. alan tudge: that's exactly right. and the parliament's pretty tight at the moment, as you know. so, you want to be down there. peta credlin: great to have you. as i said, you gave a terrific speech last week and some of the statistics that really leapt out at me: you pointed out that melbourne was expected to grow over the last 15 years at half a million, it grew at 1.2; australia was expected to grow by about 2.5\u00a0million, it grew at 5\u00a0million\u2014again, over the last 15 years. you say that most of this population increase\u201460 per cent of it\u2014comes from immigration, not locally-born population increases. we're adding a canberra to australia every year and an adelaide\u2014you know, population size of adelaide\u2014every three and a half years. so, we're bursting at the seams; we're doing, i think, more migration heavy lifting than almost any country in the world. this is a very good analysis of the problem\u2014what are you going to do about it? alan tudge: well, i also outlined some solutions in that speech as well, peta, if you keep reading. peta credlin: oh, i read it\u2014you take us through them. alan tudge: so, in essence i outlined a number of points which we want to implement to, in essence, take the pressure off the big cities, but also support the growth aspirations of some other parts of australia, because while that is true that we've been growing very fast, we've actually had nearly all the growth in the three big capitals of melbourne, sydney, and brisbane, and anaemic growth elsewhere, including in the regions, when often they're actually crying out for more people. i mean, the south australian premier said that he wants an additional 10\u201320,000 people more each year in south australia. so, one of the plans that we have is to see if we can settle more people into south australia and into the regions which need more people and want more people, which would support them as well as take pressure off the big cities. of course, we also have to continue to invest in the infrastructure, which we're doing at record levels. and finally\u2014and this is also, i think, the most important\u2014is we do need a better planning framework which integrates more closely our overall population measures and our immigration measures with the state-based infrastructure and service support, because the problem with our federation is we're largely in control of the population levers; it's largely the states that are in control of the services and the infrastructure being built on the ground and we need a better planning framework to merge those two. peta credlin: i want to pull apart two things there you talk about: a population plan and the issues in relation to regional communities. i put the regional communities and smaller-population states like south australia to one side. let's talk about your population plan. australia doesn't have, it hasn't had a population plan. it's happenstance that we arrive at those numbers because they're built into the underlying budget forecasts. i regard immigration numbers as a ponzi scheme in the federal budget because a lot of the cost with migrant intakes at record levels is borne by the states, but the benefit sits there in the commonwealth's growth forecast. do you propose an actual plan that people will be able to read as a policy before the election? is that what you mean by a population plan? alan tudge: yeah, we will have a population strategy before the election, which we will have a document out there for the australian people. but you were outlining earlier, peta, talking about the fact that we grew well in excess of expectations, and in part that occurred because in 2007 when kevin rudd came in, he almost overnight, without telling anybody, doubled the immigration intake and that turbo-charged our population growth. at the same time, or at least a few years earlier, you had bob carr in new south wales, at least, saying that sydney was full. and so this is where you had the disconnect between the state and the federal governments, a very clear one: a state premier's saying that we're full, not building for the future; a few years later you have the prime minister turbo-charging the population growth. so, what i'm saying is that you have to better align those. we have to have a planning framework which takes into account different states' ambitions for population growth, different regional ambitions for population growth, and then blend our- and then plan accordingly the infrastructure and the services to sit alongside that. peta credlin: so, minister, are you going to actually have a number, though, in your plan? and are you going to- i know recently peter dutton had some drop in the numbers, but that was focused on permanent migration numbers. of course, net overseas migration picks up the permanent and the temporary\u2014anyone here on a visa at any given time. so people at home understand, it doesn't matter whether they're here permanently or temporarily\u2014if they're sitting in the traffic or on the tram or trying to get into the public hospital, an extra person is an extra person regardless of the visa category. are you going to address the net overseas migration and will your population plan actually have a number in it? alan tudge: to the first question, which largely you're talking about the immigration levels. as you point out, last year we did bring down the permanent migration levels to the lowest level actually in a decade, and they're basically the same rate as in the last year of the howard government and as a percentage of the population, actually lower than the final year of the howard government. in terms of the temporary migration, which is the other half, we're expected to see a slowdown of that this year for a variety of different reasons. so, we are seeing a slowdown of permanent migration and of temporary migration as well. in terms of putting an absolute- peta credlin: [interrupts] let me interrupt, sorry. alan tudge: sure. peta credlin: but the last lot of abs numbers that came out on your watch, your government's watch, were the third highest in australia's history. yes, kevin rudd\u2014i hear your point. he had two years where he had number one and number two in terms of australian record immigration numbers, but you had record number three. so, will they come down and will you have a number in your population policy? alan tudge: yeah, the growth rate will come down this year and it will do so for a few reasons. certainly in terms of, for example, the 457s, which are a short-term working visa, we've basically halved those numbers since we first came to office. it's likely that the kiwi numbers are also coming off slightly, and some of the other numbers are slightly coming off. now, a considerable part of the growth in the last few years has also been just tourist numbers. now, we want tourists, we're trying to encourage them to come here because they bring money into the country; same with international students. that's been a large part of the growth in the temporary migration as well. and again, we welcome international tourists. so, we've got to get that balance right. but net overall, the growth\u2026 peta credlin:  [talks over] will we have a number, alan tudge? alan tudge:\u00a0\u00a0  but net\u2014i'm just sort of explaining\u2014the net, the growth rate is coming off. now, will we have an absolute number overall? there are forecasts in the budgets in terms of the net overseas migration. and over the forward estimates, peta, they do come down with that- which is the combination of permanent and temporary. i'm asked, quite often: do we need an overall aggregate number for, say, 30 years' time? and in part, i'm not sure about that. i actually think that we need to manage the population growth, constantly have projections, and track ourselves against those projections. but the key thing is to manage the growth and have the infrastructure to support it, rather than necessarily having a target number in 30 years' time, which we're aiming to hit or not hit. peta credlin:  okay, the quick thing i have to deal with before we go to a break\u2014and i'm sorry we have run out of time\u2014but how will you get migrants to country areas if there are no jobs, or there are pressures on education and health services? and how will you keep them there, because i don't think that we're going to have spot audits of people to say that they're living in the country town they said they would move to? alan tudge:\u00a0\u00a0  yeah, a couple of things. firstly, it's a misnomer to say that there's no jobs in the smaller cities such as adelaide or hobart or perth or the regional centres. indeed, there was a report put out today by the regional migration institute (regional australia institute) which said there's 46,000 vacancies in the region today. there are jobs going begging today. now, in relation to how you actually keep people into the regions\u2014we already do that, peta. we do that through the 489 visa, which already has conditions upon that visa to stay in the regional area, if indeed you choose to accept that visa and go and work in that regional area. and that's policed quite well, the people will have to stay there for two years. and the breaching of that visa is tiny, about 0.2 per cent of all the visas overall given. so, we've got a methodology for doing that. so, it's not a radical idea, this. but what we do know is there are smaller states, there are regions that want more people. meanwhile, we want to take the pressure of melbourne, sydney, southeast queensland; we can actually solve both problems at once through this decentralisation plan. peta credlin:  okay, i'm going to have to leave it there. i'm sorry we've run out of time. will you commit to me to please come back when you've got a little bit more flesh on the bones, when you've got some policies there, hopefully legislation this side of an election, fingers crossed, and go through it in detail. because i tell you, it's one of these issues i am deluged about from ordinary people who are concerned about where australia is headed. alan tudge:\u00a0\u00a0  yeah, absolutely peta. now, i've been talking about some of these all year. we have got good plans coming up and they will be announced well before the election. peta credlin: excellent. thank you, minister. you're one of the bright ones down there in canberra, so i'm glad you're in that portfolio and not wasted somewhere else. alan tudge: [talks over] thanks, peta. peta credlin:  thanks for your time, alan tudge. alan tudge: thank you.

begin by acknowledging the owners of the land on which we meet, the kulin nation- the wurundjeri people of the kulin nation, pay my respect to their elders, past, present and emergent and remind ourselves that 97 per cent of australians are migrants and descendants of migrants to this land. the emphasis yesterday and the opening plenary from ian harper was on big cities and immigrations as motors of both economic productivity and equity. we're here today to continue that conversation. the house of representatives standing committee on infrastructure, transport and cities has just released a report called building up and moving out: an inquiry into the australian government's role in the development of cities, which i'm sure you've all read in preparation for this session. and the report recommends better coordination of transport and land use planning within and between all three levels of government, greater connectivity within the sprawling city regions of australia, and stronger use of value capture\u2014and i think there's at least one person in the audience who will be very happy to hear that\u2014to ensure infrastructure funding as cities grow and intensify. there are of course growing public concerns about increasing spatial inequalities, the decreasing ability of young people, older people, and poor people to access suitable housing and to get between work and home in our cities, and even to obtain local services like schools, child care, and health care. and we heard in the last session how child care and health care are two of the fastest growing sectors of the economy. today we have to be honourable alan tudge, the commonwealth minister for cities; the honourable anthony albanese, the shadow minister for infrastructure, transport and cities; and sally capp, the lord mayor of melbourne to speak about priorities in addressing these urban infrastructure issues and regional infrastructure issues. i'd like to thank the made possible by melbourne campaign as the session sponsor and i'd like to mention the conference social media hashtag. join the conversation on twitter using, what is that, #outlookconf18. the way the session is going to run is that each speaker has been asked to make some opening remarks for 10 minutes. there will be a time-keeper frantically waving signs, and then we'll be facilitating i hope as good a

and one or two other things. alan tudge: oh well, thank you so much carolyn. and it's great to be up here on a panel with anthony albanese and also with sally, our brand new lord mayor here in melbourne. as you know our cities are changing rapidly. i am a melbourne boy born and bred, and actually grew up on the very outskirts of the city in a place called pakenham, which i'm sure you've heard of. when i was growing up there, it was just a few thousand people. and in fact i was born in the pakenham bush nursing hospital. that's what the hospital was called. today that town is 46,000 people and there are suburbs from here to pakenham and beyond, 55\u00a0kilometres out. that's how melbourne has changed. now, melbourne like all of our other big cities is now bigger. it's brighter. it's cosmopolitan. they're vibrant, they're economic powerhouses, and they are magnificent. you know, having said that, our challenge is to maintain the great liveability which our cities are known to have. and as you probably know, each year the economist puts out the liveability reports on our big cities, and typically and remarkably we often have four out of the top ten most liveable cities in the world from our nation here in the southern hemisphere. quite incredible. our challenge is to maintain that liveability. but we're being stretched on that dimension of liveability, and in part because very rapid population growth combined with lack of infrastructure in the past which means that our big cities\u2014particularly melbourne and sydney but also southeast queensland\u2014are now suffering from pretty serious congestion, and our roads are getting slower as you'd know if you live here in melbourne. our trains are getting fuller and more congested, and i know the grattan institute(*) had said that at least a quarter of the melbourne train services for example are congested to the extent that they're interrupting the timetabling. and these problems are real for everyday families, particularly those in the outer suburbs, and they do have an economic cost for the nation as well. we estimate the cost of congestion today is about $25\u00a0billion and there are forecasts for that cost to rise to $240\u00a0billion by 2030. so congestion due to population growth and lack of infrastructure keeping up is a very serious issue for everyday families. it's a serious issue for businesses and it's a serious issue for our economies. having said all that and having acknowledged in some respects the big cities are always going to have some congestion, our congestion problems in melbourne and sydney particularly have been made worse than what they could have been for today. they should not be as bad as they are today, and in part because two things occurred in in the past which we are now just catching up upon. and those two things were, in some respects, a lack of infrastructure expenditure and particularly in this instance in sydney. and in sydney you had former premier bob carr who effectively said that sydney was full, and in the process in saying that didn't plan for the future of sydney. so that's the premier on one hand is largely in charge of infrastructure development, and on the other in 2007 the rudd government is almost overnight almost doubled the immigration intake. and so on the one hand you've got the premier of the biggest capital city saying that sydney's full, not really planning for the infrastructure of the future. and on the other we've doubled the population intake such that the population forecasts were- have been almost- such the population rate has almost been double what the forecasts were. and so we had a mismatch, complete and utter mismatch, between the infrastructure built even for planned population, let alone for the turbocharged population growth which we actually had. now melbourne was a bit the same in terms of we had very rapid population growth, well in excess of forecasts. so when you look at the abs forecast in melbourne, back in 2004, it predicted that by 2000 17 that our city would it would have grown by 500,000 people. in fact it grew by 1.2\u00a0million people in that time. so, extraordinary growth above forecast expectations and we are now just catching up in terms of the infrastructure build in order to accommodate that. i think you particularly see that in sydney where there is infrastructure being built right across the city right now, \u00a0greatly assisted by the federal government's contribution towards it. you're starting to see that in melbourne as well, but i think particularly in sydney in a couple of years' time that that city will flow much, much better than what it is today. i should say also that from the federal government's perspective trying to deal with that catch up, we have slowed the migration levels down and in fact last year permanent migration levels were 162,000 people: the lowest level in a decade and as a percentage of the population that increase was actually smaller than the last year of the howard government's. we've also mentioned in terms of catching up on that even in the last five years massively increased the infrastructure spend, and- as have all governments done that and there's now major infrastructure projects right across the country in every major capital cities [sic]. that's where we are and have got to today in the rapid catch up phase if you like. how do we then think about it going forward in terms of maintaining the liveability of our big capital cities and ensuring that we can deal with congestion as best as humanly possible, acknowledging that is always going to be some congestion in large cities? and there's four things that i think that i would like to outline and touch on that we can do and that the federal government will be doing. first thing is continued massive infrastructure expenditure from the federal perspective. we have a $75\u00a0billion program and it's a 10 year program which means that there's long term forward projections. second we want to very quickly- and that's largely, that $75\u00a0billion is largely for the intra-city rail and road corridors. it's the monash freeway here. it's the tulla rail [sic]. it's the melbourne ring road. it's the westconnex in sydney, northconnex et cetera, and replicated in the other big capital cities. that's the big infrastructure. we've got to continue to work on that. second is that we have to address those local congestion pinch points in the local suburbs, if you like, because often it's actually the local intersection which holds people up more than it does being stuck on the freeway. i have one in my electorate knox which is 30 to 35 k's away from here. the henderson road bridge. it's been on the books for 30 years, hasn't been built but with $6\u00a0million it will make a very significant difference to thousands of people's lives in terms of getting to work. third point's\u2014and this has received most of the media attention\u2014is to ease the population pressure of our big cities and more rapidly grow our smaller capitals and some of our regions. now, i say this because the primary population challenge which we have is that we've got very rapid growth in melbourne, sydney, and southeast queensland. some of the fastest growing large cities in the world- in the developed world and on [sic] the same time we've got quite modest growth elsewhere around the country. and yet there are other parts of the country such as in south australia, such as in the northern territory, such as in western australia, such as in tasmania, where the leaders of those states have said that they want to grow their populations faster. so there is an opportunity for us from a migration level to be able to support the aspirations of those chief ministers and premiers for their population growth and slightly ease the pressure off melbourne and sydney particularly, because nearly all the population growth in melbourne in sydney has been for migration. in melbourne last year, or(*) 65 per cent of the growth was migration. in sydney was 83 per cent. so you only need to ease back the population- the migration growth slightly and you can make an impact in terms of easing the pressure on those big cities. it can be done. in fact, we already do it through the 489 visa. and so the critics who say that this is an impossible thing to do, i say we already do it. second- now, that's just one lever to grow the smaller capitals and some of the regional areas. a second lever is of course that you can build fast rail and try to connect to orbital cities. if you can get to ballarat and back in 45 minutes rather than the current 75 minutes, that makes a massive difference to ballarat's growth and takes pressure off melbourne. third, we can try to grow those economies more generally in terms of the regional centres and we're going to be doing this. we have almost a billion dollars on the table to support that. and fourth\u2014and i won't dwell on this but maybe we can we can get to this\u2014you can also try to get more jobs in the outer part of the big cities so that there's less congestion on the roads, because typically a lot of people from the outer suburbs will travel further to the work. we're doing that particularly in western sydney through the western city deal. finally, in terms of the fourth part of the plans, i've largely talked about infrastructure for points one and two, i've talked about distribution of population growth in terms of point three. finally, and arguably the most important elements of what we need to do going forward, is a better planning framework because at the moment at the federal level we largely dictate the population growth levels but the states and territories largely dictate the infrastructure, and we need a better match and a better planning framework where we are much more closely tied together with the states and territories and indeed municipalities to talk about growth aspirations and infrastructure matching that. and i'd be happy to expand on that in the q and a. i think my time is up, i saw the one minute flag so i'll leave it there and i'll hand it over to anthony albanese. anthony albanese: thanks very much. i begin by acknowledging traditional owners of country and pay my respect to their elders, past and present. i thank carolyn for the introduction and for my colleagues for joining us on this panel. we were given a few topics which we wanted addressed in this panel, so i'll go through them quickly in a bit of a different order, because i think the first question that we got was how do you get that better planning which is what alan finished his contribution on. the great challenge of infrastructure to break the nexus between the infrastructure investment cycle, which is by definition long term, and the political cycle which is three or four years\u2014and in reality can often be one year before we're in election cycle in between terms. the structure to do that is already in place i believe. we did that by creating infrastructure australia. that's precisely why we created it, to have a body at arm's length from government making reports based upon cost benefit analysis about what projects could best boost productivity and deal with sustainability and liveability issues as well, to provide that advice to government, do it in a transparent way and then government could decide whether they invested or not. government's still the decision-maker in terms of priority projects, and we did that i think very effectively under the chairmanship of sir rod eddington. that's changed somewhat. we now have had in more recent years a project as announced by government and then infrastructure australia later on propose whether they support it or not, or it goes on the list whilst it's already under construction. and projects like west connex that are on the list that alan mentioned in sydney, they began tunnelling four years ago. they're still not sure where the tunnels are coming up. there still aren't all the exit points. there still is not a proper business case. they've had difficulty in terms of the financing of that project and it's example of planning gone wrong. but also is an example, i think unfortunately, of a failure by infrastructure australia to properly independently assess projects on their merit and to make sure there was that rigour in terms of driving that government funding. secondly, we established the major cities unit\u2014an urban policy forum\u2014to have ongoing engagement in that, including with the former lord mayor of melbourne was a part of that. the major cities unit i believe should play a role in city partnerships. our version of the city deals but- that the governments announced, but one which we believe should be bottom up. one which should genuinely be partnerships with the three levels of government that goes to the second of the questions that we had to ask, which is how do you get coordination across our federated system. the other thing that we did was to establish a coag committee\u2014chaired by brian howe, deputy chair was lucy turnbull\u2014very consciously, to try to drive that change through the coag agenda of how city planning could be done much better. indeed, adelaide was the only city that came out of that process by getting a big tick if you like. now, there is a reason for that of course. melbourne and sydney are particularly difficult. part of sydney's problems is its geography and topography that is there. but we had that, and i think that the committee on population that has been suggested by bill shorten in correspondence with scott morrison would be a similar way to go: establish a committee with six people agreed to by all sides of politics that would lift up the political debate about population, about distribution, so that- about settlement policy, so that- neither of the major political parties i don't think wants to see the population debate reduced to what some people would like to see, i.e. stop the world, we want it all to stop or the reason why there is urban congestion is because of people who don't look like you. and that's the danger with the population debate which is out there and i think that- i hope that the government gives a bipartisan process that would be long term some serious consideration. i think in terms of- so that's planning and also coordination across the levels. the third issue was we were asked to come up with what our three priorities would be. the first of mine is high speed rail down the east coast. i think that if we're serious about talking about decentralization taking pressure off our capital cities, there are two things we could do. one is a genuine fibre based broadband network that would change the economics of businesses being located outside of our capital cities from one disadvantage to one of comparative advantage because of the lower overheads that are there from businesses being located in regional centres. and if we're going to get people to move to regional centres, there must be jobs in those regional centres. so we have to work out ways in which that can be facilitated. similarly, high speed rail. the thing that made in the study that was done- the economics of high speed rail change wasn't just the under three hour trips from sydney into melbourne and sydney to brisbane, both of them in the world's top 10 air travel list. it is the growth in terms of regional cities along the way. and that would be a transformative project which would make, i believe, an enormous difference; and as infrastructure australia have said, the cost of high speed rail would could be reduced by up to $3.5\u00a0billion if we get the planning, corridor acquisition, all of that done sooner rather than later. the second is real investment, including particularly on urban public transport. we can't solve problems in our cities with just roads. roads are important, but unless you deal with urban public transport particularly moving away from the hub and spoke approach of the way that our urban public transport systems are designed so you can go across lines\u2014such as been suggested here in victoria with the suburban rail loop, such as the western sydney rail line from the north-south through badgerys creek airport\u2014they're the sort of projects that you need to deliver. the other thing is that we need to actually get real about what the investment is. peter costello yesterday gave a critique of the 10 year vision argument because frankly it's a nonsense. we, you know, change prime ministers a couple of times every few years. the idea that a 10 year plan can be taken seriously as opposed to real investment in the forward estimates, it is a nonsense. and the truth is that the forward estimates funding in terms of grant funding, real dollars for real projects, falls from $8\u00a0billion to $4.5\u00a0billion across the forward estimates. it falls from 0.4 to 0.2 over the 10 year cycle in terms of infrastructure investment as a share of gdp. and what's more, some of the investment- the idea that you can have value capture and off-budget investment to build public transport is a nonsense, and perpetuating this fantasy will mean that some government down the track will have to deal with it. you can get some funding from value capture. you can't get all of it. the fare-box produces about 20 per cent. 20 cents in every dollar of just operating and maintenance costs. in order to be off-budget a project has to not only deliver operating and maintenance costs, it has to pay back the capital, which projects like inland rail won't do. which projects like melbourne airport rail won't do. and what we need is to actually get serious about that. the last point i'll make in terms of my third priority is about liveability and sustainability of cities. we need to- we will have an ongoing political problem unless we deal with the fact that as we do go up, we need to have green space. we need to have a green and blue strategy. we need to protect our urban waterways. we need to protect our quality of life. we need to make sure that we have sustainable energy and water supplies. there are ongoing issues in sydney and melbourne i know whereby literally kids don't have anywhere to play, and that's before the sporting teams come up of the growth that's happened of women in afl and soccer and cricket and other sports.\u00a0 sally capp: last but not least on this panel today. good morning everyone. on behalf of the city of melbourne, i also acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today and pay our respects to their elders past, present, and emerging, the people of the kulin nation. it's brilliant to be here engaged in this conversation and a very important topic, not least of which with the expertise of carolyn, the experience of anthony albanese and alan tudge, but also noting that we have lots of experts here in the audience, so looking forward to some of that conversation. i'd like to acknowledge my fellow councillor nicholas reece, terry moren and michelle mercon (*) in particular, as people that have been part of city building for a long time here in australia, so it's lovely to see you. well melbourne has been highly praised for its liveability over many, many years and it's a lovely accolade to have. but liveability is much more than an index. the question of liveability in our cities is tightly linked to australia's future prosperity and that is what we need to focus on. australia's majors- major cities are in the midst of a massive transformation. alliterations not that easy even in the middle of the day. melbourne is one of the fastest growing cities in the oecd and will be central to driving our next generation and wave of productivity across the nation. as lord mayor of a forward looking optimistic capital city council, i say let's grab this opportunity with both hands and make the most of it. it's not a pause; it's a straight forward at a pace. melbourne's current transformation is not new. it started around 30 years ago in the 1980s. back then, as many of you will recall, there was no street life at all. we had a city that catered for cars not people and after 5pm the city was grey and empty. fast forward to 2018 and it's a very different story. through careful urban design and deliberative policy making, melbourne's streets, laneways and buildings are now vibrant, sophisticated; we've embraced our river, we attract nearly a million visitors every day into the heart of our city for good reason. fewer cars, more pedestrians, more residents, more green spaces, a mind-blowing cultural calendar, a strong safety record and an evolving cycling and public transport network are all major cities that have frequently won us the world's most liveable city. and we are proudly diverse. we are home to more than 200 different cultures speaking 230 languages and dialects. our migrant history fascinates us and delights us. it is one of our strengths. so to put some dollar signs around melbourne, our city economy currently sits at about $95\u00a0billion dollars and is a powerhouse. we've transformed ourselves from a manufacturing city to a knowledge city and this will be our future. but, of course, there are lessons that we've learned over time and there's plenty still to be done and we've heard a number of those things from my colleagues on the panel this morning. there are planning lessons that we've learned over the last 30 years; we didn't get everything right. we know from south bank and docklands and the experience there that major urban renewal projects need to be developed holistically. jobs, affordable housing, transport, services and sustainability measures need to be woven into the master plan from the start and then we can capture value and look for innovative ways to fund because we have the plan right. community engagement is another essential ingredient to get the human nuances of liveability right. our most painful lesson is our most expensive and that is the impractical way that we have to play catch up on essential infrastructure. we're all feeling the pain as we retrofit our train network here in melbourne and we grapple now and more than ever, with housing affordability issues. so where to from here? how do we apply the lessons that we've learned over the last three decades as the population in greater melbourne rises from 5\u00a0million to 8\u00a0million? how do we maintain our enviable living standard as we become more of a global player and a global city? as i said, and as we've all noted, we have the growing pains and there are things that we don't like from crowded public transport and roads through to homelessness. and all of these things increasingly drag our productivity down and we want to be able to drive our national, regional and city prosperity. so i could identify a dozen or so of the most pressing infrastructure projects that meet the demands of our next century, but our metropolitan planning firstly requires a complete reset. we need to set in place a coordinated, co-operative governance framework across three tiers of government, cities equal local government. and through this framework, find a bipartisan commitment to drive productivity through our cities. federal and state governments need to work hand in hand with local governments to unlock investment and to coordinate fund and deliver complex projects over long timeframes. this requires deep, long term committed partnership. a federal minister for cities, population and infrastructure is fantastic, but it would be great if he was in the cabinet sitting with other ministers such as the treasurer and the minister for local government. city deals are wonderful, but they need to be tied to infrastructure that delivers genuine productivity uplifts and in the places that have the biggest impact a la melbourne. cities also need a seat at the coag table and a voice at the coag table to ensure earlier identification of trends and issues and better integrated outcomes. we are at the coalface of what is happening in our cities. in the meantime, we are advocating for our 21 cities to come together under the banner of a council of cities to strengthen the advocacy position with state and federal governments. and in victoria, we're very much looking for that accord across the levels of government to help us define a common vision and speak with a united voice on projects and priorities. that united voice would help galvanise our efforts across those projects that can really make a difference. two thirds of the jobs in melbourne's city centre are knowledge economy jobs, which contribute 60\u00a0billion to our gross local product. we have 100- sorry, 1100 start ups. we've got our universities working together with our international students to create something that is very vibrant. but we need to keep building on our world class r&d and biomedical research precincts to create what are the jobs and the industries of the future. melbourne has two major urban renewal projects that deserve our focus and our coordinated efforts. our commitment to infrastructure has to be at the centre of unlocking the value of those urban renewal precincts. on the one hand, arden macaulay is sitting right there on our melbourne metro one project, on the other the largest urban renewal project in australia\u2014fisherman's bend has no currently committed public transport solutions and that's something we need to change quickly. 80,000 residents 80,000 jobs; we need public transport at the core. so, we must not forget another key element of infrastructure is homes. housing should be considered as an essential economic infrastructure platform for our productivity and for our success into the future, and it is often underrepresented and under invested. recent history would suggest that the great hope of bipartisan support for long term nation building across all three tiers of government is a thin hope indeed in australia. however, i am optimistic. we've done it before; we built the snowy hydro scheme over 25 years. we built the great ocean road over 20 years and not so long ago, we built melbourne's rail loop over nine. right now, we're building melbourne metro one. we should be planning melbourne metro two. we don't lack the space or intellect here in australia to tackle the challenges facing our nation. we just lack the collaborative policy and governance frameworks to make it happen. this is our big opportunity to create a prosperous future for all. thank you very much. [applause] carolyn weitzman: i would like to thank all three speakers for comments that were not only informed and thoughtful, but delightfully terse. they've left plenty of time for a question period with, as sally capp just said, some very bright people in this room. but i am\u2014tom is here with a roving mic\u2014just as while you wait to put your hands up, i'm going to take the moderators privilege and ask the first question. there's been a very frightening report\u2014international report this week about climate change and i have to say that climate change hasn't had a huge amount of discussion in the conference thus far, and we know that the un sustainable development goals focus very much on the role of cities in the environmental future of the globe. how are your infrastructure priorities affected by the reality of climate change and perhaps i'll just move my way down the panel if that's possible? you can start. anthony albanese: the first is that good policy on cities has to take into account climate change, it has to be-\u00a0 climate change policy can't be something that's just sort of debated in terms of energy. transport, for example, is our fastest growing area of emissions. so we need to look towards new technology; what the impact of that would be. we also need to look at the design of our cities. the concept of the 30 minute city\u2014one of the benefits that we had from the- having the major cities unit producing reports, the state of australian cities. in the last one that they did, they identified the drive-in drive-out suburbs as a real issue. as sally said, spoke about the transition of cities like melbourne; the problem with the knowledge economy is that not everyone's in it. so what you have in places like sydney and melbourne, with the decline of manufacturing, is that a whole lot of people are living suburbs where they can afford to buy a house, but there aren't jobs there. so they're commuting, spending more time going to and from work than they are at home with their kids. part of what we need to do and one of the benefits of something like badgerys creek airport, is that that's about trying to turn around sydney, so everything doesn't look in, some things look out as well. and you can do that. so, i think that needs to be incorporated in the design of cities as well. the urban design protocol that we\u00a0 produced in government, took very much the focus of urban design can make an enormous difference. that means not just the nature of buildings with water recycling, renewables; it means the spaces between buildings as well. the idea of the heat island effect, when you have these big developments with just concrete,\u00a0 just as a disaster for the impact of heat on our cities. so we can have a cooling impact as well, and the work that the greater sydney commission has done, i think is really important\u2014that whole blue and green city idea is very worthwhile. i know that melbourne city council has been a leader in this, in terms of local government. sally capp: we have. thank you. thank you for that acknowledgement. and i agree. i think climate change and sustainability policy is needs to be integrated across everything that we're doing, so that it's not seen as something that's separate and to the side. having said that, we are at the moment finalising our own climate change and sustainability policy and it really does that; how do we embed these considerations into everything that we're doing? i'd really like to, i guess, call out one big acknowledgement of what's happening with the way that we live going forward, and that is that the great australian dream is moving from serenity to amenity. and i think that's a terrific thing because as we really come together and appreciate density and the ways in which we can live in a in a very comfortable and fulfilling way, but in a denser way, also drives a lot of opportunity for us to manage climate change. we do need to increase green spaces, which is what we're doing here in the city of melbourne. we haven't added to our park land since the 1850s in any significant way. over the next 12 months, there'll be two new parks of over two hectares each, another one coming online the year after that. and if i can get my highline park going, that'll be almost three hectares running right through the centre of the city. so recognising the importance of those green spaces. but on the basis that they are more and more relevant, the more people we have using them. and just to touch on again, that more people and the economies of scale on waste is really driving a lot of the efficiencies in our innovation around waste, not least of which has been our pilot on compacting bins in alleyways in the more dense areas of the city, that residents and businesses can use as a very effective way of dealing with our waste. that pilot has been completed successfully and we will now continue to roll that out. we can only do that because we have the economies of scale to be able to support that type of investment. so i think that that amenity and density can really support climate change outcomes. alan tudge: i think very briefly, you have less congestion, you have fewer emissions. it's almost as simple as that, they are completely aligned. and you can do that through a number of ways, as i was outlining: increasing public transport is certainly one way of doing that. here in melbourne, 81 per cent you still buy cars, only 19 per cent of people are using public transport. in sydney, it's 67 per cent to 33 per cent. so melbourne lags sydney in that regard. now, we want to get say for example, the melbourne to tulla rail link going, and we've put five billion on the table to make that happen. that will reduce emissions from all the cars on the tulla freeway. we've got a commitment to getting monash university the single biggest university campus in australia, finally connected to the rail link. it is ridiculous that it's not connected to the rail link today. the bus link from monash to huntingdale station is the single busiest bus route in australia. you get mass transit through there, you reduce emissions as well as take those buses and cars off the road. briefly, in terms of western sydney, the western sydney precinct which we are developing is another great example of that, where if you're creating the housing and the jobs and the infrastructure all out in western sydney -\u00a0 which is what we're doing centred around the massive western sydney airport developments, which we've funded and have just kicked off the first site a couple of weeks ago\u2014then people don't need to travel as much from the outer suburbs of western sydney into the cbd, so that can also help. carolyn weitzman: can i just ask the people who ask questions to identify themselves and to also identify the member or members of panels, that they wish to ask questions of? i think there was a question up at the front to begin with. question: sorry, i don't want a hog. rick morton from the australian newspaper. i'm going to direct this to minister alan tudge, but if albo particularly wants to cut in as well, it would be nice. just on the population stuff that we've been talking about all week; has the federal government done any modelling on the reduction in the permanent migration intake to 162,000 in the last year, in terms of the economic cost? has it modelled whether we should do a pause on immigration? and are you considering a pause on immigration? alan tudge: i'm asked these questions all the time about the immigration rate rick, as you probably know. now, last year, the immigration- the permanent migration rate was brought down to its lowest levels in a decade to 162,000 people as i said. it's likely that the temporary migration will also come down this year for a bunch of different reasons. and we consider though, the migration settings every single year as part of the budget context. so i'll just leave it at that. what i've indicated this week as well though, is that we do need a more sophisticated planning framework, which broadly marries population policy at the federal level\u2014which in large part is driven by our migration settings\u2014with the states and local governments infrastructure and planning regimes, so that we don't have the mismatch, which we particularly saw, and i was explaining earlier when bob carr sort of said we're full, kevin rudd puts the accelerator on population. and then we wonder why sydney became overly congested and we're rapidly catching up in terms of trying to address that. question: no pause? alan tudge: well we've made our settings for the next financial year. so every year we go through the planning process. so this year the cap\u2014and caps the [indistinct] into the permanent migration as you probably know\u2014the cap again was set from memory 190,000. but that's the cap, it's not a target. and last year, it came in at 162,000. it'll be again looked at as part of the budget context for next year, of course, all the states and territories get consulted upon that. carolyn weitzman: there was a question- sorry. anthony albanese: just- apart from the fact bob carr was sort of gone when kevin rudd came in. alan tudge: but infrastructure takes these in advance [indistinct]\u2026 sally capp: boys, boys, boy. anthony albanese: in terms of, well it's just a fact. in terms of these issues, i think one of the things that i think needs more focus which is about planning, is about labour market planning. so jobs that are available, to actually check first if there are australians available for it. and secondly, though more importantly, i think, we need to look at all governments\u2014bypass and client\u2014haven't done enough to deal with trades training and tafe and looking after vocational education and training. it is absurd that we have jobs that are created and we can't fill them with australian labour in traditional areas. and you can do it\u2014a range of projects that we did northern expressway in south australia, had almost 20 per cent were apprentices. you can use- there are ways in which the commonwealth can use its leverage as well to make sure that you get those training opportunities there. but we need to be training now for what the jobs of the future will be because that will have an impact on stopping some of, or reducing\u2014you won't ever stop it completely and you shouldn't\u2014but we should be reducing the reliability that we have on temporary migration. carolyn weitzman: yes. that lady there. question: hi, my name is leslie martin. i'm from the department of economics at the university of melbourne and my question is actually to all three. so cities around the world are restructuring the way that the toll roads in order to target congested areas or congestion directly itself. and the idea behind this is to ration roads using prices rather than the misery of being stuck in traffic or the unpredictability associated with it. so my question to you in this is, is this an option for australia, for melbourne? and if no, why not? sally capp: okay, well in our draft transport strategy, one of our papers for debate was on a congestion tax and actually this is an issue that goes beyond our municipal boundaries, but one that we think is really important given the interplay of congestion and the productivity in the city. and we had some surprisingly robust debate on that, which i think is a good thing. but unfortunately, certainly, at a state government level we just had a no. and i think what you're saying is we definitely need to be considering it and the role that it can play in how we can better manage congestion on our roads. i've lived in cities where they have congestion pricing and it has been a very effective way of creating behaviour change and also systems that recognise equity and fairness as part of that so not to unduly burden those that can't afford it. so we are in favour of considering congestion pricing and the way that that works on congestion in the city of greater melbourne. alan tudge: these are largely state government decisions. personally, i don't support them because some of our most congested roads might be a big freeway, such as the monash freeway which goes all the way out to the outer suburbs. and it just means it disadvantages those people in the outer suburbs who may not be able to afford to purchase a house in malvern or somewhere further in. so, i would not be supporting a congestion charge on the monash; i never would. and maybe the state government will, but that won't be something which i ever support. anthony albanese: the timing of tolls can have an impact. for example, the sydney harbour bridge, which has a variable toll depending upon what time people can go, can change behaviour. so, markets\u2014prices can be a mechanism that sends signals, but certainly i agree with alan about my concerns is one of equity. people in western sydney are going to be paying up to $14,000 a year in tolls to get to and from work; $14,000. if you're on $60,000, that is almost\u2014that is an enormous percentage of your after tax income. the average salary in australia is 57\u2014the median sorry, the median salary. so, my concern is that it needs to be linked with public transport so that people have options. if you want to send a price signal, they got to have somewhere else to go, and the option has to be to go on trains to try and encourage that public transport behaviour. but often, the people paying the tolls are the people who don't have the public transport options. sally capp: and i agree. it can't be a lever on its own, and that's why it will also force a rethink on policy. and that policy is not just on public transport as an option\u2014i agree that that's a powerful one -\u00a0 but actually where our jobs located. and that recent grattan report found that actually in the last 10 years in our major cities, congestion hasn't changed, or travel times have not changed significantly. and the major finding of that was that people are choosing jobs in different places to avoid congestion. and alan and i can argue about what it actually said later. carolyn weitzman:  the woman in the front, yes? question: lesleyanne hawthorne, university of melbourne. my question is to the minister and the shadow minister. australia has had 70 years of attempting to disperse recent immigrants. there is no problem at all with carats (*), people will be highly responsive to visas such as the announcement this week. but the issue is retention; what we get constantly, in any field you can look at, is churn. and the churn is always back into the direction of the major capital cities, which is also a global phenomenon. can i ask you to comment on what would be different in terms of the outcome of the proposed visa changes that were announced this week? thank you. alan tudge: so, we haven't announced all of our detail yet in relation to this. but what i said is: that there is an opportunity to provide further incentives to choose smaller cities or smaller states such as south australia. and there's an opportunity to provide conditions upon visas to remain in those locations for at least a few years. now, there's nothing radical about this idea. we already provide some incentives as you probably know if you're applying for the points based system and you want to apply- and you want to go a region or one of the smaller states outside the big cities, you get an additional five points. you need to get 65 points to be eligible to come into australia. we then placed some conditions on people's visas already through the 489 visa which says that you must stay in that particular location. so, it's not a radical idea; we do this already. there's opportunity to expand that further, particularly for the states that want to grow faster. now, premier marshall, i've spoken to him. he wants south australia to have at least 10 to 15,000 more people each and every year. the chief minister of the northern territory, he wants to grow the northern territory faster. the premier of tasmania wants more growth- more migration into tasmania; same in western australia. so, there are actual opportunities there. we've also got some regional towns who cannot get workers presently.\u00a0 warrnambool, just down the road\u2014not just down the road, three hours down the road. beautiful seaside town, as you know. the mayor came and saw me and said: we've got a thousand jobs going, begging today. so, if we can work with them and support their population growth ambitions, it also takes a bit of pressure of melbourne and sydney. and so it's a win-win in that regard. it's absolutely possible, and we have more to say about this later this year. anthony albanese: it is a challenge, but i agree with alan that it is possible to make a difference. he's spoken about jobs, and that's certainly the case. but i think also\u2014it comes down to quality of life. people who've given up sydney and moved to newcastle and love it. people who've given up melbourne and gone to bendigo and ballarat and love it. and victoria's probably been better, frankly, than any other state at growing and prioritising those regional cities. you got to have jobs, but it's got to be sustainable long term jobs as well, because\u2014and that's why, i think, also you need\u2014i think it's one of the big arguments, as i said before, on high speed rail; is that it would be a game changer. question: abigail payne, director of melbourne institute. so, i'm kind of struck on this conversation around congestion and traffic and stuff. i moved to australia two years ago from ontario, canada. and what was going on in ontario canada two years ago was this provincial government, the local governments, the universities were very actively talking about how are we going to deal with roads and congestion through the use of autonomous vehicles. and one of the things that has really struck me about australia is that we're not having that same conversation, even though we're talking about congestion and the same types of issues. so, i don't know if you have any comments on that, but i would like to hear your feedback on why that conversation isn't happening. sally capp: well, we're certainly\u2014and maybe we're just not having the debates in the public enough. it's part of the draft transport strategy, we had a paper also on autonomous vehicles and the impact that's going to have on the city\u2014both positive and negative\u2014and the plans that we need to make. and it's one of the options, certainly, going forward. but i think when we talk about congestion, we are completely fixated, at the moment, by roads, and we've got to be mindful of congestion also on public transport. we have a lot of congestion on our footpaths, and we really need to have this whole debate looking at all modes of transport to make sure that we get that balance right. because every time we make a switch when we're looking at a mode of transport, it does actually impact the decisions we're making around planning, resource allocation and long term outcomes. so, making sure that we're considering all of those modes as we move forward is important. but certainly, we've got discussions, interesting discussions underway on autonomous, because they bring a lot of efficiency to people moving around our city. carolyn weitzman: mr alan tudge and mr albanese? alan tudge:\u00a0just very briefly, i think the conversation is going on in relation to autonomous vehicles and the use of technology generally to deal with congestion, and i think that conversation will increase. i think it was only a week or two ago, the deputy prime minister announced an office of future transport technologies, precisely to look and coordinate some of those ideas and plan for the future as well. because it's not just the technology in the vehicles, but it's also the technology that you can use on the roads as well. melbourne, we're actually pretty good in terms of managed freeways, for example. even those, you know, when you get on and off the\u2014sorry, onto the freeways where you have might the traffic lights who've just slow you down and guide you on. we did that on nearly all of our freeways here in melbourne; just starting to do that in sydney, and there's not much of that at all in the other major capitals. but little pieces\u2014little technology like that can make a difference. other technology can greatly assist, i think, transport congestion in the future as well. anthony albanese:\u00a0yeah look, new technology can make a difference. the managed motorways program, when infrastructure australia looked at it, some of the projects had a cost benefit analysis of $13 benefit for every dollar invested. so, often we look at new infrastructure. often getting better use of infrastructure makes more sense. there's a massive growth in the use of share vehicles around australia. i think that there is a debate, but there is a debate largely amongst, i guess, academics and policy makers rather than at the grassroots level. but i think that will happen. i think we're completely underprepared for the expansion of electric vehicles which we can see happening. the impact that that will have on fuel taxes, and therefore on paying for roads, for example. paul fletcher, alan's predecessor, was very committed to trying to get a process going there, and to try and get a debate. that stalled, essentially. i think we are a country that has had that historic reliance upon people thinking that their car is an expression of their identity and their individuality, and it's hard to shift that. but over a period of time, i think it will. sally capp:\u00a0i thought you were going to say manhood, for a moment there. anthony albanese:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  well, i was going to quote tony abbott on what the private motor vehicle represents. sally capp: [talks over] i'm glad we moved away from that. [laughter] carolyn weitzman:  we only have time for one more question, and definitely no time for that discussion. anthony albanese: [talks over] you could look it up for yourself. carolyn weitzman: we have time for one more question, and we're actually going to take the gentleman with the polka dot socks in the front. that's you, nicholas. [laughter] question: thanks, carolyn. anthony albanese: [talks over] very impressive. question: alan, congratulations for lifting the population debate to the front pages across the nation. it is a very, very important debate. i guess i want to go back and just interrogate a little further this idea of forcing new immigrants to go to the regions. you've touched upon the warrnambool abattoir and their thousand jobs\u2014i think about 3,000 in regional abattoirs across australia that are acquired, and we often hear about the murray val- up along the murray: fruit pickers being needed as well. but i put it to you that that's a drop in the ocean, compared to the 160,000+ a year new immigrants that are coming to australia; 80 plus per cent are coming to melbourne and sydney because that's largely where the jobs are. so, would accept that without a sort of jobs and industry plan, and an infrastructure plan up front, that forcing people to go to places where there aren't jobs, will be an economic and social disaster. sally capp: is that a statement or a question, nicholas? alan tudge: the\u2014what we've been talking about is not just regional areas. and there are some regional areas crying out for more people\u2014and i just gave one example of warrnambool because i happen to have engaged directly with the local mayor there. and indeed, it was in the front page of the local paper said: headline: wanted: a thousand workers. and\u2014but that's just one example in warrnambool. i've engaged with the state premier of south australia, right, at a state level rather than a small regional level. and he's talking 15,000 people per annum extra into south australia. now, that's one element, and of course, you want to marry that with the economic development opportunities as well. but into south australia, you've got massive ship building, you've got massive defence contracts. we're doing more and more public sector investment into there. the economy is now really picking up there, as well to be able to support that growth. so, you need to plan this and you need to coordinate this. and in part, that's why i'm saying which was sort of point four of my overall four-point framework, which i outlined, which is a better planning framework collectively, so that you're engaging with the state governments and engaging more with the local councils to understand their population aspirations, and marry that then with your infrastructure and your economic development as well. [applause] carolyn weitzman:  i would like to thank\u2014end by thanking the melbourne institute, the university of melbourne and the australian for sponsoring this very important discussion about cities in the wake of productivity and equity concerns. i'd like to thank the three excellent speakers who i think, brought a much needed level of complexity into the debate. and i would like to advise you that the next session will take place in the mayfaie room on economic outlook: the view from business. thank you very much for coming. [applause] "], "congestion-challenge-more-infrastructure-and-stronger-population-planning-get-better-cities": ["09 October 2018", "a little over a month ago, prime minister morrison created a new portfolio which merged population policy with urban infrastructure and cities policy. it made a lot of sense to combine these three areas as they are so interconnected. population growth, for example, is the major reason for building more infrastructure, while our big capitals are where most of the growth is occurring. if we get these three levers right, then our cities will be even better places to live. this is my first major speech since taking on the responsibility for this new portfolio. my intent today is not to cover every aspect of the portfolio, but to focus on one of the most pressing challenges for residents in our big cities: congestion. particularly on our roads and transportation systems, but also more generally. as the \u201cminister for congestion busting\u201d, to use the prime minister's descriptor, i want to take you through how we are thinking about the congestion challenges. i will describe the nature of the challenge, its underlying causes and some of the ways we are thinking about addressing it. this is an infrastructure challenge, but also an employment and population challenge. let me start by examining the problem. the issue of congestion is felt in large population centres across australia, but is particularly felt in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland, which, as i outline later, has accounted for three quarters of australia's total population growth over the last five years. there are families every day that are stuck in traffic, spending hours on the road each week which they could be spending at home. many of the trains have reached crush capacity, if there is a train line at all. the data backs up what residents, particularly those in the outer suburbs, know from daily experience. in sydney, for example, travelling in peak times takes 65 per cent longer than the same journey in off-peak. in melbourne, it is 55 per cent longer and in brisbane 45 per cent longer. these peak delays have got longer and peak hours start earlier and finish later. to illustrate, let's take my home town of melbourne and consider an average 30\u00a0kilometre trip to work on a freeway. ten years ago, an off-peak journey of this kind would have taken, on average, about 21 minutes. today, that same journey would take about 27 minutes. if we now look at the morning peak, when most people travel to work or school, a decade ago the same journey would have taken around 31 minutes. today, that journey would take 43 minutes. but that's not the end of the story because urban congestion also makes trip times less predictable and reliable. and as we all know, there are many things where you just have to be on time, such as medical appointments, job interviews or picking up the kids from netball training. so now you have to leave even earlier to be sure you will be on time, even if this means waiting at the other end. ten years ago, to ensure you made it on time 90 per cent of the time, you had to leave 8 minutes earlier. today, you would need to leave 15 minutes earlier for every trip. putting this all together, our standard 30\u00a0kilometre journey in melbourne's morning peak is starting to push an hour. remember that trip took about 20 minutes off-peak and about 39 minutes at peak in 2007. and keep in mind this is average congestion, not the worst.  of course, the longer the commute, the longer the delay. this means residents in the outer suburbs of our cities, where jobs are often further away from homes, are typically the worst affected by urban congestion. i see this in my own electorate in the outer east, here in melbourne which is over 30\u00a0kilometres out from the city centre. like many suburban areas, the congestion related issues frequently rank in the top issues of local surveys. and for good reason\u2014an extra 10 minutes travel time each way equates to a loss of over three full days extra spent on the road each year. it is not just our road network that is facing congestion challenges, our rail networks are also feeling the pressure. in sydney, there has been a 30% increase in rail patronage over the past 5 years. in melbourne, the public transport network is also tightening, with many lines already at capacity during peak hour and continuing to see strong demand. similarly, brisbane will face increasing pressure into the future. over time, people adapt to congestion but it is not costless. some drop out of work or take less productive jobs as the traffic gets worse. if families move, they have the expense of high stamp duty among other things. for businesses, it is sometimes impossible to avoid the added costs. some business leaders have told me that they are now trying to do a lot of their distribution during the night, but this has its own challenges if receiving businesses are not open. more often, they simply absorb the costs. overall the costs of congestion to the economy are already great and rising steeply. the bureau of infrastructure, transport and regional economics estimates the costs of congestion in australia's capital cities to be $25\u00a0billion a year in 2017/18 rising to $40\u00a0billion a year by 2030. this is a serious challenge for families and a serious economic challenge for the nation. to address these challenges, we need to understand the drivers of congestion. it is a fact of life that as cities become larger they get more congested. but there are particular factors driving the increases in urban congestion in australia. first, our population is growing rapidly. in absolute terms, we grew by 3.75\u00a0million people which is nearly twice as many as in the previous decade. as an immigration nation, we have had periods of rapid growth since european settlement, but our current growth rate has only been surpassed by a brief period in the 1920s (when our population was around 5.5\u00a0million) and during the \u201cpopulate or perish\u201d period immediately following world war ii. of course, in absolute numbers, our growth has never been higher. our nation is adding a city the size of canberra every year and the size of adelaide every 3.5 years. moreover, the multicultural composition of our population is also changing rapidly. today, over a million australians have chinese heritage. our biggest immigration sources are now from china and india overtaking the united kingdom and new zealand. so not only are we growing fast, but our diversity has also rapidly increased in the last two decades. the main factor driving our growth has been net overseas migration, accounting for sixty per cent of population growth over the last decade, while the remaining growth has been due to natural increases. that is, more children being born and people living longer. most notably, there was a step change increase in population growth from 2007 under the rudd government, almost entirely driven by lifting the immigration rate. our growth rate in the previous two decades largely sat at about 220,000 per year, consisting of about 120,000 increase from natural growth and 100,000 from net overseas migration. in the last decade, it has been sitting at about 375,000 with only a minor increase in natural growth (to about 150,000) with the rest in migration. permanent migration was around 200,000 per year over the past decade. last year, we granted 162,000 permanent visas which was the lowest level since before the rudd increase. temporary migration has also increased in the last decade, increasing by about 70,000 per year, whereas previously it was increasing by about 20,000 per year. this was largely due to new zealanders, international students and those on bridging visas. we have brought those on 457s down considerably since the record peak of 130,000 visas when bill shorten was employment minister.  there are benefits of a larger, more diverse population. a larger population means a larger economy. with this comes greater opportunities for australians as larger companies are more likely to be present and headquartered in larger countries. we can more easily achieve economies of scale in public and private services. further, there is more scope for investment in public goods, including national defence. it is much easier to pay for new submarines with a $1.5 trillion-dollar economy than one half the size. however, there are also challenges. i have been discussing the integration challenges throughout the year in my previous role as citizenship minister. this includes having almost a million people that struggle to speak the national language, a higher than ever concentration of the overseas born in particular areas, and a small minority that is challenging our values and sometimes using violence to do so. but the greatest challenge is the pressure it puts on our big cities in the form of congestion. this is a serious problem in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland particularly, which the coalition government is rapidly addressing (which i will come to shortly). this challenge is exacerbated by the fact that 75 per cent of the population growth has been to our three largest population areas: melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. while the overall population of australia has been growing at the rapid rate of 1.6 per cent per annum, our three large population centres have been some of the fastest growing cities in the world. melbourne last year grew by 2.7 per cent, sydney by 2.1 per cent and south east queensland by 2.3 per cent. only canada has experienced comparable growth of its large cities amongst the oecd countries.  as with the overall population growth, the main contributor to the growth in melbourne and sydney has been net overseas migration. in melbourne, it has contributed 64 per cent of the growth in the past year, while in sydney it has been 84 per cent. in south east queensland, the growth is an almost equal combination of natural growth, internal migration and overseas migration. the fact is that 87 per cent of all skilled migrants are going to sydney and melbourne, and nearly all of the humanitarian intake. we want to have a more even distribution, as i will explain later. the challenge in keeping up with such population growth would be hard enough, but two things have occurred which have exacerbated our congestion problems today. first, the growth rate for our nation (and particularly our big cities) was well above projections. for example, the 2002 intergenerational report predicted australia would grow by about 2.5\u00a0million over the last 15 years. we actually grew by 5\u00a0million. again, this was largely due to the step change increase in migration around 2007 (and a slight improvement in life expectancy and a higher birthrate compared to forecast). between 2004 and 2017, melbourne was projected by the abs to grow by 500,000. it grew by 1.2\u00a0million.  this mismatch between projections and actual population growth has made it more challenging for governments at all levels to appropriately plan for, and invest early, in the essential infrastructure needed. this is particularly the case given the long lead times to plan and construct major urban infrastructure projects. second, there was insufficient infrastructure built in the early 2000s, particularly in melbourne and sydney, to cater for forecast growth, let alone the actual growth. former nsw premier, bob carr, for example, famously said that \u201csydney is full\u201d and used it as a reason not to build for the future. in melbourne, we have had the fastest growth, but major brakes put on projects such as cancelling the desperately needed east west link. we have been in catch-up phase since. all government expenditure on infrastructure has increased markedly\u2014greatly assisted by the federal coalition in the last five years\u2014but as the chart below shows, it has typically lagged population growth by a few years. when the population has already grown before the infrastructure is put in place, the cost of building the roads and rail escalates. consequently, we get fewer miles built from our infrastructure buck.  moreover, while large projects are being built, as is occurring in every major city across australia, and particularly in sydney, the congestion sometimes gets worse before it gets better. in a couple of years' time, though, sydney will be transformed. the final factor driving the congestion we are experiencing today is that there has been a mismatch between the distribution of jobs and housing across some regions. for example, in sydney around 80 per cent of residents in the eastern sydney cbd region live and work in that same region. however, for the growing western, southern and central districts, only around 50 per cent of residents' work in the same district that they live in, with many undertaking long daily commutes into the cbd or to other districts. big cities will always face some congestion. australians understand this, but our big cities today are suffering more than they should, as i have outlined. we need to learn from this and take leadership to ensure that there is a better future ahead. this is exactly what the coalition government has been doing, and particularly prime minister morrison through his bringing together of population, infrastructure and cities policy. our plan consists of four parts. first, a massive boost in infrastructure expenditure to build the major intra-city road and rail networks. the government lifted expenditure as soon as we came to office and in the last budget, allocated a record $75\u00a0billion with forward 10-year plans. a significant proportion of this investment is allocated to building the intra-city transport spines, such as the monash freeway, tullamarine rail, westconnex or ipswich motorway. the intra-city transport spines shape how cities look and the opportunities they provide residents. we have major investments underway in every major city and several in the three large cities, including both major road and rail upgrades. we are targeting these upgrades to alleviate the congestion already being faced in these cities, but also to help design more efficient transport networks for future growth. for example, westconnex will move traffic off the congested and overutilised parramatta road, helping commuters bypass 52 traffic lights, cut travel commuter travel times from parramatta and the kingsford smith airport by up to 40 minutes, and halve the bus travel time between the inner west and the city. in the long run, it will also support greater urban amenity across the corridor by taking around 4,000 trucks a day off parramatta road. state governments are ultimately responsible for building these city road and rail networks, but we are taking a stronger leadership role through our 10-year infrastructure pipeline announced in the 2018\u201319 budget. these critical projects need to be well planned and backed by a quality business case and we will continue to be guided by infrastructure australia on these. but what we most need to do now is get on and build them. ideally, some of the major intra-city road and rail networks need to be built in advance of the demand, not well behind it. this avoids the higher expense and disruption which occurs when major infrastructure is retrofitted. second, addressing rapidly the very local congestion pinch-points. the focus of infrastructure expenditure is frequently on the major national or city corridors, but sometimes it is local pinch-points that causes the greatest delays for commuters. for example, in my own electorate, a simple bridge has been missing between the north and south side of henderson road. this $6.5\u00a0million bridge will cater for thousands of residents within the knox municipality, knock minutes off their commute, and take pressure off the busy stud road. we are already investing in local congestion busting packages, but in the last budget, we set aside a further billion dollars to address urban congestion. the entire fund will be used for these localised pinch-points, mainly in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. three quarters of the population growth has been to these areas and so we will be focusing much of our investment there. we will have a robust, data-driven process and begin to make decisions early next year. third, we aim to ease the population pressure off the three big cities and more rapidly grow the smaller states and regions. the challenge for australia is that our population growth is not evenly distributed. as i outlined earlier, we have very fast population growth in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. but at the same time, we have the smaller states and many regional areas that have barely grown and crying out for more people. south australia, for example, grew by just over 10,000 people last year. melbourne grew by 10,000 every 28 days! south australian premier, stephen marshall, however wants to grow south australia by another 15,000 people each year. the same pattern is mirrored in many of the smaller states and territories. for example, the northern territory chief minister wants to grow darwin faster. the tasmanian premier has indicated his desire to more rapidly grow his state. further, there are regional areas across australia that simply cannot get people to do the work available. three hours from here, in the beautiful seaside town of warrnambool, they have unemployment of 3.8 per cent and businesses struggling to get workers. the recent headline of their local paper was \u201cwanted: 1,000 workers!\u201d. other regional parts of the country are the same. the opportunity is to get a more even distribution of growth across the country to support the smaller states and regions, while taking pressure off melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. one of the ways we can do this is through directing new migrants to smaller states or regions. matching the skills of new migrants with the skill shortages in rural and regional australia will be key to the success of this approach. as i indicated earlier, net overseas migration accounts for 60 per cent of our overall population growth and around 75 per cent of the growth of the big two cities. hence, settling even a slightly larger number of new migrants to the smaller states and regions can take significant pressure off our big cities. there are some constraints on this, of course. for example, 25 per cent of our annual migration intake is directly related to an employer sponsoring a person for a job where they cannot get an australian. we do not want to jeopardise the growth of those sponsoring businesses, and hence the wealth of our nation. a further 30 per cent concerns family reunion; typically, an aussie marrying a foreigner. we cannot send a person's spouse to a different state! but apart from these two categories, there is no geographical requirement for a newly arrived migrant. we are working on measures to have more new arrivals go to the smaller states and regions and require them to be there for at least a few years. in that time, the evidence suggests that many will make it their home for the long term. this will require close cooperation across different agencies, including with regional development minister bridget mckenzie, to ensure we get the settings right so that those smaller states and regions can benefit economically from population growth. a further method for supporting regional growth (and taking pressure off our big capitals) is to better connect and integrate our orbital cities. fast rail is an effective means of doing this, as has been noted by the federal parliament's joint standing committee on infrastructure, transport and cities, led by john alexander mp. if a person in ballarat, for example, can commute to melbourne in 45 minutes rather than the present 75, then the opportunities for ballarat's growth would accelerate markedly. we are presently investigating the potential for faster rail links between our big capitals and surrounding regional centres. three detailed business cases are already underway and will be finalised early next year\u2014newcastle to sydney; sunshine coast to brisbane; and shepparton to melbourne. victorian opposition leader, mathew guy's $19\u00a0billion commitment to fast rail from melbourne to geelong (32 minutes), to ballarat (<45 minutes), to bendigo (70 minutes), and to traralgon (62 minutes), is consistent with our agenda. we would be pleased to work with him on his decentralisation plans should he be elected. we can also more generally develop and support the growth of our regional centres and smaller capitals. we are doing this through several initiatives: the final element of our plan is to have a better population planning framework. one of the challenges of our federation is that the primary population levers are set at the federal level, while the states have the primary responsibility for implementing the transport infrastructure and government services (such as schools and hospitals) to cater for the growth. we need a better planning framework that can better join the two together. this will involve engagement with the states on a more regular and systemic basis to determine population objectives for each region and better aligning federal and state infrastructure expenditure to support these objectives. australia has some of the greatest cities in the world. in the most recent economist magazine survey, three of our capitals were in the top ten world's most liveable. our cities are vibrant, cosmopolitan and economic powerhouses. we want to maintain this vibrancy and economic growth. we want to continue to invest in their supporting infrastructure, including: sporting, cultural and environmental assets. but we also have to be serious about the challenges of very rapid growth, particularly the congestion challenges. we have to do the short-term fixes, but also invest for the future and have better plans that match our population growth with infrastructure development. "], "radio-national-breakfast-interview-fran-kelly": ["09 October 2018", "fran kelly: at the moment, every year, australia's population grows by about the size of the city of canberra. three-quarters of the new arrivals settle in either melbourne, sydney or southeast queensland. this rapid population growth brings economic benefits to the state but it also poses big challenges. one of the most obvious to commuters is congestion, with the peak hour crush on our freeways and public transport now getting worse. australia doesn't have a population policy but the federal government is promising it will tackle the problem through new visa conditions. the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population is alan tudge and he'll outline his plan for busting the congestion in a speech today. minister, welcome back to breakfast. alan tudge: good morning, fran. fran kelly: you're again proposing making visas for new migrants conditional on them settling in smaller cities and regional areas. can you tell us more about this? will there be incentives? how are you going to compel new arrivals to live outside sydney, melbourne, and southeast queensland? alan tudge: yes. thanks, fran. the essential problem which we've got, which you touched on, is that we've got very fast growth in melbourne, sydney, and southeast queensland but quite slow growth elsewhere in the country, and what we're trying to do is get a better distribution of that growth so it can help those smaller states and some of the regional areas, which are crying out for more people, and take a bit of that congestion pressure off melbourne, sydney and southeast queensland. now, one of the tools there is through migration because nearly all the growth is due to migration. so if we can get even a few more percentage points of the migrants going to some of those smaller states or into the regions rather than coming to melbourne or sydney, then that obviously achieves our objectives. fran kelly: and how would you do that? what new visa conditions are you proposing? alan tudge: yeah. so how we can do that? we can do that through a combination of incentives and some conditions. now, we haven't outlined the exact details here yet but it's a relatively straightforward thing to be able to provide incentives for people to go to some of the regional areas or some other smaller states and as soon as- fran kelly: [interrupts] what kind of incentives? alan tudge: \u2026and as soon as- well, there already are some incentives in place. for example, you get additional points through the points-based system at the moment to go to some of the smaller states or to regional areas for example. so, we'll be looking at things like that. now, then you can also put conditions upon people's visas as well to stay in a particular area for at least a few years and in that time, you hope that they make it their home; that they settle; that their kids go [indistinct]. fran kelly: [interrupts] and you're going propose that? putting conditions on it like that? alan tudge: well, that's exactly what we're looking at is the combination of some encouragement as well as some conditions. with the overall\u2026 fran kelly: [interrupts] under the conditions, what would happen if someone then left the place that they'd been settled in? is there a penalty for that? is their visa revoked? and how do you keep track of people? alan tudge: yeah. again, we haven't outlined all of the precise details just yet, fran, but i mean, we\u2026 fran kelly: [interrupts] would you like to? alan tudge: [laughs] \u2026but we've put conditions on all sorts of visas. i mean, even today, if you've got- if you're coming here on a work visa, then you obviously have a condition about being sponsored by that particular employer. nearly every visa has conditions attached to it, so it wouldn't be unusual to have a geographic attachment to a particular visa. fran kelly: speaking of being sponsored, exactly who will this apply to? because i think i'm right\u2014in your speech you say: 25 per cent of migration is sponsored by employers so those people have to go where the employers are; 30 per cent are family reunions so they need to live where their families are. so, what migrants will this apply to? and will it be enough people to make a difference to the congestion in our bigger cities? alan tudge: yeah. well, as i mentioned, if you look at the growth of melbourne, which grew very fast last year, about 65 per cent of the growth here in melbourne where i'm from was due to migration growth. so you only need to take a relatively small proportion of that growth and place it into one of the smaller centres or one of the smaller states and you can make a real difference to melbourne. so, that's what we're looking at. now, you point out quite correctly that we don't want to interfere with the employer-sponsored migration because when a business can't find an australian to do the job, then we want to enable them to sponsor a person into the country, but about 45 per cent of our visas aren't attached to a geographical location as such and therefore there are opportunities to provide those incentives and encouragements to reside elsewhere. fran kelly: would that apply to people arriving on humanitarian visas? refugees, obviously, would need support networks and largely, not exclusively, these are in the major capitals. would you have to bring in support services if you're going to make people in humanitarian visas move to regional centres, for instance? alan tudge: yeah. we already have some of the humanitarian intake go to the regional areas and sometimes they do phenomenally well, as you probably know, fran. i think you might have covered some of those stories. at the moment, nearly all the humanitarian intake comes into melbourne and sydney, and meanwhile though, we actually have places right around australia including in rural areas which are crying out for workers; and so there may well be opportunities to have further numbers of the humanitarian intake go to those regional areas, where there is local community support for that to occur\u2014and that's the important thing and obviously, you do have to have the services in place to support that to occur as well. fran kelly: we're talking about congestion\u2014are you implicitly blaming new migrants for the congestion in our cities when critics say the real blame should be shifted back to the politicians for poor planning of infrastructure to cope? alan tudge: i'll outline this in a bit of detail in my speech today, fran. and in essence, i think two things happened, which explain why we've got more congestion at least than what we necessarily should have today, and that is back in 2007, there was an unexpected step change increase in the migration intake by kevin rudd, and that means that our population growth has been well above what the projections are. and second, you had a period, a decade, a while ago, when we didn't have the level of investment in the infrastructure required even for the expected growth, let alone, the supercharged population growth; and so we're in a bit of a catch up phase today. now, i think we are rapidly catching up, particularly in a place like sydney, where as you probably know, fran, there's infrastructure being built right across the city right now supported by the federal government and in a couple years' time, that city will flow much, much better. but what we need, importantly in the future, is a better planning mechanism which does combine that population planning with the infrastructure and the services planning together and that's also what i'm outlining today as well. fran kelly: i'll come to population planning but one of our listeners\u2014it's neil\u2014has written in to say: it's business that need to move out of cities, the rest will follow. and that's true to some extent\u2014people go to sydney and melbourne because of their jobs, aren't they? alan tudge: [talks over] absolutely. yeah. well, yes and no. i mean, that's part of it as well that we do want to encourage those regional centres to grow, and in many cases, they're putting their hands up to say: help us to grow. i've flagged, for example, that we're investigating some fast rail at the moment so we've got some business cases in three fast rail areas including melbourne, including sydney to newcastle and melbourne to shepparton. now, if those were enacted, of course, that would support the economic growth of those regional areas and take a bit of pressure off melbourne and sydney respectively too. fran kelly: well, if fast trains would make a difference, why doesn't the federal government just bite the bullet and build a fast train? alan tudge: well, we are doing some investigations into fast trains at the moment and- fran kelly: [interrupts] you've been doing investigations for 30 years. alan tudge: well, we've got three good business cases going on at the moment and we'll get those back early next year. i should say, here in victoria, the state opposition leader matthew guy has put a very bold plan here on the agenda with four fast rail corridors to be built should he be elected and that would slash the time to get to places like bendigo and ballarat, to shepparton and to traralgon, so that you could actually reasonably reside in those places and commute each day to melbourne. i think that would be a game-changer. fran kelly: you're listening to rn breakfast. it's 7.45. our guest is alan tudge, he's the population, urban infrastructure minister or the minister for congestion busting. you are talking about population planning and working more closely with the states, but cooperation on a bipartisan level would also be crucial, wouldn't it, for long term planning? and over the weekend, bill shorten wrote to scott morrison with a joint party plan to tackle population growth, suggesting an independent and expert population task force to make recommendations to governments. now, the prime minister dismissed that offer, why? alan tudge: i think the prime minister in part dismissed it because if the leader of the opposition was serious about this, he actually would've sat down with the prime minister rather than write him a letter and putting the letter in the newspaper before even speaking to the prime minister. now, i'm laying out a plan today as to how we're thinking about congestion; how we're thinking about getting a better distribution of population across the country. we would welcome the leader of the opposition's support for this plan. fran kelly: well, you need it. i mean, the country needs it. if population policy changes every time the federal government changes, we're in trouble, aren't we? alan tudge: [talks over] well, yeah. well, and i hope the leader of the opposition will come out today and back in the plan which i outline. fran kelly: and does the plan- would the government be working toward some kind of population target? because without that, how can you plan? alan tudge: listen, i'm not convinced that you need an exact number that we're aiming for into the future. i think what we do need is controlled population growth; and we do need to set out the forward projections of what that might look like and where that might be and have the infrastructure to match it; and ideally, the infrastructure built in front of that population growth rather than behind it, which is what we've unfortunately seen in the past. fran kelly: alan tudge, thank you very much for joining us. alan tudge: thanks very much, fran. fran kelly: alan tudge is the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population. he'll give the speech today. "], "abc-news-interview-virginia-trioli": ["09 October 2018", "michael rowland: the federal government is moving closer to imposing strict visa conditions on some new migrants, requiring them to live in regional areas for five years to help address the population boom that is choking australia's major capitals. population growth has outstripped forecasts by almost 100 per cent over the past decade in australia's biggest cities, leaving transport and infrastructure sadly lagging. virginia trioli: in sydney and melbourne, peak hour travel times are now more than 50 per cent longer than the off peak. the minister for population and urban infrastructure alan tudge will outline his plans to tackle the problem, in a speech he'll make in melbourne today. and the minister joins us now. alan tudge, good morning and thanks for joining news breakfast. alan tudge: good morning, virginia. virginia trioli: what's your plan? alan tudge: well, it's a four-part plan. i mean, the first two parts involve heavy investment in infrastructure. the third part involves a decentralisation agenda, taking a bit of pressure off the very rapidly growing population centres of melbourne, sydney and south east queensland, and growing some of the smaller states and the regional areas. and the fourth element of the plan is actually having a more coordinated population planning process where we integrate our infrastructure investment with our forecast population growth rates. virginia trioli: and so tell us about the move of some\u2014i understand some not all\u2014migrants to regional areas. is that correct? alan tudge: yeah, that's exactly right. i mean, virginia, the essential issue we have at the moment is that nearly all of the growth in australia is into the three big population centres of melbourne sydney, and south east queensland, and that's putting enormous pressure on melbourne and sydney particularly, and we see that in the congestion on the roads every single day. if we had a better distribution of the growth across the country it would take the pressure off those big cities and help the development of the regional areas and the smaller states. now, the biggest lever there is the migration lever because most of the growth has been from migration, about 60 per cent of it. so, even if we get a little bit more of the immigration intake going to some of those smaller states such as south australia, it helps them and it helps melbourne and sydney. virginia trioli: well, the expert consensus on this, to the contrary, alan tudge, on the issue of what's putting this pressure on our cities is not actually the population but the expert consensus from across the grattan institute, across to the crawford school of public policy, is that the failure to upgrade infrastructure and also the inactivity of state governments to increase supply is the reason why you have that big infrastructure pressure. that's true, isn't it? alan tudge: oh well, there's a couple of things which occurred. one we had a very significant increase in the population growth back in 2007 when we had a step change increase in the migration rate put forward by kevin rudd. and the second thing though, virginia, was that the infrastructure in the past wasn't built to cater even for the planned population growth let alone the supercharged population growth that we subsequently saw. so, we're now in a bit of a catch up phase\u2026 virginia trioli: [interrupts] sure, but just to jump in there, that actually goes to the point doesn't it about the failure to maintain? alan tudge: in some respects, that's right. so, in some respects we're in a bit of a catch up phase. now, if you look at sydney, for example, right now there is infrastructure going on around the city, in a couple of years time that whole city will move much more smoothly. but one of the key points of my plan as i was outlining before, virginia, is that we actually need to have a more coordinated concerted population planning process which involves the state governments and more directly determines where a population will grow and having the infrastructure to match it and ideally put in place in advance of that growth rather than behind it. virginia trioli: so, are you going to cut immigration, is that part of it as well? alan tudge: we already slowed down the immigration rate just slightly last year. and we look at the immigration rate every single year. but the key issue here is the distribution of the growth, more than the actual growth number. if we had a better distribution of the growth [audio skip] sydney and south east queensland. virginia trioli: how are you going to guarantee that there are jobs for these migrants that you'll force out to the regional areas? alan tudge: well, we're not- we're talking about some of the smaller states and some of the regional areas. and some of those areas today, virginia, as you probably know are crying out for more workers, they simply can't get a warm body to do the job. now, i'm here in melbourne, a few hours down the road in the beautiful seaside town in warrnambool, they're looking for a thousand workers today to fill empty jobs. the mayor has spoken to me about that. i've spoken to the south australian premier and he says he wants to grow the state of south australia by an extra 20,000 people each year, and he'll have to work there to do it. so, the work is there. there are regional areas and smaller states that want to grow more quickly, and if we can support them in their objectives it also takes pressure off our bigger population [indistinct]. virginia trioli: look, i get that but you can't compel people to take a job that they don't want to do. alan tudge: oh no, but we already have some visas which require new migrants to go to some of the smaller states or [audio skip]\u2026 virginia trioli: ..is what you're describing today just a continuation of that same program where it's targeted visas, it's particular skill shortages that are missing in australia and employers then apply to actually bring those people in\u2014457s and the like\u2014is this just an extension of that, is it anything substantially different? alan tudge: [audio skip] is actually only about 25 per cent of the overall migration program. you have a family reunion scheme, which is another 30 per cent. now, each of those in some respects is geographically located by definition but the rest is not. and so, there are opportunities for- to be able to encourage people to go to some of the smaller states and the regions and then place conditions upon their visas or at least for a few years for them to stay there. now, in that time you hope that they settle and they make it their home. virginia trioli: sure, but how will you compel them to stay there? alan tudge: oh it's- when somebody's on a visa then we can easily place conditions upon it. now, we haven't announced all the details exactly how we're going to do that yet but it's reasonably straightforward to do that, virginia\u2026 virginia trioli: [talks over] how? alan tudge: \u2026obviously once a person has got full citizenship, then they're able to live wherever they like. that's one of the benefits of citizenship, before that time a person is on a visa and you can place conditions upon that visa. virginia trioli: but let's say, using the warrnambool example, this person is compelled, required to go to warrnambool and they don't get one of those jobs and can't find one of those jobs, do you compel them to stay there? alan tudge: well, virginia, we haven't outlined all the exact details yet but the overall\u2026 virginia trioli: [interrupts] you're welcome to do that now. alan tudge: well, [laughs] thank you. many people do come into the country already on the points based system, for example. and when they do so, sometimes they already get bonus points if they go to the regional areas or they go to some of the smaller states. but the evidence shows they might use the bonus points to go to some of the smaller states but not necessarily stay there for very long. so, we want to provide that (a) the encouragement and (b) put some conditions upon a person who might want to go to the smaller states, help the growth rate of those smaller states or indeed the regions, and in doing so it takes the pressure off the bigger cities of melbourne, sydney and south east queensland. virginia trioli: alright and just finally this morning on one of the biggest stories really of the week and really of the decade. as minister for population and cities, i imagine the ipcc's warnings about dangerous global warning must be ones that you're taking very seriously. it seems a very strongly compelling argument to phase out entirely any coal-fired power plants. is that your view? alan tudge: i haven't read the full ipcc report yet. and i know the minister for the environment will be commenting on it. but we've met our kyoto targets, we met our- will meet easily our 2020 targets and we'll also meet our 2030 [audio skip] national citizen in this area and we hope that other countries do also. virginia trioli: alan tudge, we'll let you go now. thanks so much for joining us today. alan tudge: thanks very much, virginia. virginia trioli: interesting topic of conversation there. good morning, michael. not much detail there about how people might be compelled, required to go to these areas and stay there. no government can guarantee you an absolute job unless you are part of that point system where there's some sponsoring by an employer to get a particular credentialed person over to fill that job, so many gaps to be filled in yet. "], "channel-7-interview-natalie-barr": ["09 October 2018", "natalie barr: well, the federal government is moving closer to imposing new restrictions on migrants. it's among steps to be announced to tackle overpopulation in brisbane, sydney, and melbourne. under the plan, new migrants would be required to initially settle in smaller states and regions. federal population minister alan tudge joins me now. good morning to you. so unplanned\u2026 alan tudge: good morning. natalie barr: \u2026population growth has outstripped all the forecasts. how many people are you going to send out to the regions, and for how long? alan tudge: well, the essential problem, natalie, that we've got, is we've got very fast population growth in melbourne, sydney, and south east queensland, and yet we have very little growth in some of the smaller states and in the regions. and indeed, in those places, they're often crying out for more people. so our overall objective is to try to get a better distribution of that population growth across the country. because if we do that, we take pressure off those big cities which are feeling the congestion at the moment, and we help the economic growth of those smaller states and some of the regional areas who are crying out for more people. natalie barr: because some people in regional areas tell us that it's hard to get jobs out there. so, you can't just kind of\u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] yeah, it depends on where you are\u2026. natalie barr: \u2026yeah, you can't just dump people out there. alan tudge: \u2026it depends on where you are, natalie. so here, we're not just talking about the regional areas, but also some of the smaller states. so, the premier of south australia, for example, says that he wants south australia to grow by about 15,000\u201320,000 more people each year. same with the chief minister of the northern territory, similarly the premier of tasmania wants to grow more quickly. you've also got some parts of rural australia who desperately are looking for workers. i'm right here in melbourne now, about three hours down the road in the seaside town of warrnambool. they need 1000 extra workers right now to work on the dairy farms, in the abattoirs, on some of the other farms, and they simply can't get those workers. so the jobs are out there, and we want to support their economic growth, and if we do that, we also ease some of the pressure on the very fast-growing population centres of melbourne and sydney particularly. natalie barr: sydney and melbourne are already experiencing such major congestion, and infrastructure problems. is it too late? alan tudge: it's not too late, but i think, natalie, we are in a bit of a catch-up phase from almost a decade ago. now, back in 2007, kevin rudd did a step change increase in the migration intake, and what that meant was that all of our population growth has been well above what the forecasts were. and then on top of that, we didn't have the infrastructure built really even for the expected population growth, let alone the actual population increase that we saw. so we're in bit of a catch-up phase. now we are catching up, and in a place like sydney, as you probably know, there's infrastructure being built right across the city, right now, supported by the federal government. in a couple of years' time that city will flow much, much better than today. but my overall message though, and what i'm going to be outlining in a speech today, is we need to continue to build that infrastructure, ideally in front of the population growth. second, we need a better distribution of that population growth, and thirdly, we'd actually need better planning, so that we can more closely marry the growth with the infrastructure expenditure. natalie barr: and i can hear people nodding their heads on the word planning. thank you minister for your time this morning. alan tudge: thanks very much natalie. "], "abc-radio-melbourne-mornings-interview-jon-faine": ["09 October 2018", "jon faine: i've lost track of the number of times we've had a chat to government ministers, labor and coalition, about population growth and taking the strain off our biggest cities, particularly melbourne: now the fastest growing city in australia and also particularly in sydney. the state opposition are making it a centrepiece of their pitch to be elected as government in november and today, their federal counterparts weigh in perhaps trying to help. alan tudge is the minister\u2014in scott morrison's government\u2014for cities, urban instructure, and population. mr tudge, good morning to you. alan tudge: good morning jon. jon faine: i think this is the fourth time i can recall in the last couple of months that we've spoken about this topic, so where's it move to now? alan tudge: [laughs] i don't know about that but this is a very big topic and your description in terms of having very fast growth in a city like melbourne is right. we grew by 2.7 per cent last year which is very fast growth. still, we've got other places in australia which are calling out for more workers. so our ambition is in part to try to ease the pressure off melbourne and support the growth in some of those other places. jon faine: i thought you were the free market party? i thought you were the party that believed in the individual and people's decisions that they make free of government interference? alan tudge: absolutely, but it's \u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] well now you're going to tell people where to live? alan tudge:\u00a0well it's in part going to be individual choice that if you come into the country in the future that there might be some additional encouragements to go to south australia rather than to melbourne and if you utilise those encouragements well perhaps we'll place a condition upon your visa that you stay in south australia for a few years before you become a citizen, in which case then you can live wherever you like. and that's still \u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] don't people want to go where the jobs are? alan tudge: that's still the free exercise of choice there if you want to take up those opportunities. jon faine:\u00a0sure. people want to go where the jobs are, though. that's why people come to melbourne in particular because the state labor government have created so many infrastructure projects there's a labour shortage. alan tudge: well people have come to melbourne and sydney for all sorts of different reasons but we have serious labour shortages also out in the regions in some other parts of australia. jon faine:\u00a0you mean for fruit picking? alan tudge: no, well you go down to warrnambool for example today, jon, three hours down the road from where we are, and they've got the front page of their local paper which says: wanted, a thousand workers, because they can't get a warm body to do the work there on the ground. jon faine: what sort of work? alan tudge: it might be in the abattoirs, it might be working on the dairy farms, it might be other works which goes on in warrnambool. and there's that sort of thing replicated across the country. in south australia the premier who i caught up with last week says that he wants an additional, say, 15,000 people each year to support the growth of south australia. same with the chief minister of the northern territory, same with the premier of tasmania. so you've got different pictures around the country of what they want to achieve with their growth, yet here in melbourne, we're growing by far and away the fastest in the country, and i think people are really feeling the pressure particularly as it may well be on the monash freeway now and it's probably a carpark. jon faine: so we have labour shortages in the cities as well, what would you propose to do about that? i fully agree it makes sense to deal with labour shortages in the regions, but there are also skilled labour shortages here. alan tudge: that's right and i actually suggest in the speech which i'm giving today that of course we don't want to interrupt the employer-sponsored migration scheme, and that is when an employer can't find an australian to do the job, they've advertised, they can't find an aussie, and that then enables them to sponsor somebody in. because ultimately you want businesses to grow because it helps everybody. we don't want to interrupt that. but that's only 25 per cent of our migration program. so there's opportunities for the rest of the migration program\u2014or parts of the rest of the migration program\u2014to provide those encouragements to go elsewhere. jon faine: education is now the single biggest sector of employment in particular this fastest growing city in australia: what do you propose to do there? are you going to mandate that the tertiary institutions that have so many students from overseas attracted to them, that they decentralise? alan tudge: we're having some discussions with the university sector but i haven't said much in relation to that. obviously we are\u2014here in victoria\u2014the international export market is a very big market for us here and we don't want to jeopardise that. we do want to encourage though, some of the regional universities to also take advantage of international students. jon faine: well economic vandalism of course, is the way it's been described by your political critics. alan tudge: sorry, what is? jon faine: the idea of mandating people move to regions where there are labour shortages; bringing in skilled migrants and asking them to do unskilled work, or forcing people to go and live where they don't want to, is being described as economic vandalism. alan tudge: right. okay. well i've described\u2014[laughs] i've described how it would still be the exercise of free choice to choose to come into australia. and at the moment- we have these- many of these things in place today, jon, whereby you can get additional- for example, you get additional points if you're applying through a points-based migration system, to go to a regional area. now people choose to exercise that and it might mean that they're higher up the list in terms of coming into the country. so in some respects it's not a radically new concept, but we want to look at this more closely. we want to provide those further encouragements. i should say too, jon, this is just one element of the overall plan of what we're discussing today. jon faine: sure, understood, and there's infrastructure to go with it. text messages \u2026 alan tudge: and infrastructure to go with it and we're putting record amounts of infrastructure as well. jon faine: yeah, which is very welcome. alan tudge: perhaps most importantly, we need to learn from the past and actually have a much more robust planning framework going forward. now that \u2026 jon faine: [interrupts] alright, now there's a couple hundred people on nauru and manus island who would be quite happy to relocate to regional australia. alan tudge: [laughs] yeah i think that's a bit of a red herring for this conversation, jon. jon faine: well some of my text messages don't seem to think so. alan tudge: i think- yeah, well i think we've been through the discussions about nauru and manus. and this is a broader question about how can we get a more even distribution of population growth across australia so that we don't have very fast population growth here in melbourne putting pressure on our big capital city and we can ease the pressure here and support the growth elsewhere. jon faine: well it's certainly what's called\u2014i think it was john howard called it the barbeque stopper; thank you for your time this morning. minister for cities, urban infrastructure, and population in the federal coalition government there, alan tudge. "], "channel-9-today-show-interview-sylvia-jeffreys": ["09 October 2018", "sylvia jeffreys: thousands of migrants will be forced to live outside sydney and melbourne under a federal government plan to ease overpopulation. new arrivals will have restrictions placed on their visas ensuring they settle in rural or regional areas for up to five years. federal minister for population and infrastructure alan tudge joins us now from melbourne. minister good morning to you. alan tudge: good morning sylvia. sylvia jeffreys: so what exactly is the plan here? where will new migrants go? alan tudge: so the essential problem which we have sylvia, is that we have very rapid growth in our big population centres of sydney, melbourne and southeast queensland and yet very small growth in parts of australia including some of our smaller states, and yet they're often crying out for more people. so our overall objective is to try to get a better distribution of that growth to take the pressure off melbourne and sydney and support the economic growth of those other areas. now, one of those levers is migration of course and we want to provide further incentives and indeed put some conditions upon some new migrants to settle into those smaller states and into some of the regions where they need more workers. sylvia jeffreys: okay, so with respect, my question there was: what is the plan? so which areas will they be allowed to settle in? which areas will be off limits? alan tudge: yeah. so we haven't precisely documented that yet. but the key problem as i was trying to outline is that we've got very fast growth in melbourne, sydney and southeast queensland which puts enormous pressure on those cities. most of that growth certainly in melbourne and sydney is due to migration and so if we can get some of that migration growth into a place like south australia or the northern territory or tasmania or elsewhere, then it does assist those big capital cities as well as assist those smaller states. now i've been talking to the premier of south australia for example and he wants at least 15,000 more people to go to south australia each year because they've had very slow growth and yet he wants to grow that state. so we want to support that ambition and if we do that i think it helps south australia and eases that congestion in melbourne and sydney. sylvia jeffreys: and will you support areas such as south australia with their infrastructure? can you guarantee that people will be able to find jobs in those areas? alan tudge: yeah. two questions there. certainly in infrastructure, we've got record infrastructure expenditure right around the country and one of the elements which i'm outlining today in the speech is to say that we need a better planning framework to better plan where our population is growing and match that with infrastructure's expenditure and services expenditure. now in relation to jobs: there are many parts of australia today who simply can't get a warm body to do the work which in new south wales for example, you've got a place like dubbo which has 2.7 per cent unemployment. in south australia, they want more people because they've got a growing shipbuilding industry, defence force industry, et cetera. so there are places that are looking for more people and yet we've got melbourne and sydney which are absolutely growing very, very fast and people are really feeling the pressure on congestion there. sylvia jeffreys: so to be clear, at this stage you haven't exactly identified where new migrants will be settled going forward? it's just not melbourne and sydney, is that right? alan tudge: well nearly all of the migrants at present go to melbourne and sydney; 87 per cent of skilled migrants go to those two big cities and that drives most of the population growth in those two big cities. now, what i'm saying is if we can just even take a proportion of that growth and put that into a place like south australia or tasmania or elsewhere, where they need more people, then that supports the aspirations of those smaller states and regions as well as eases the pressure off sydney. now, it's not the only part of our plan but it's an important one. some of the other elements which i'm flagging to support the growth of the regional areas which will include us investigating for example fast rail to newcastle or to shepparton from melbourne, as well as providing economic incentives to boost up some of the regional areas so that they've got more growth opportunities. that also would support taking the pressure off the big cities. sylvia jeffreys: just quickly because we are restricted with time i'm afraid, minister, will these restrictions apply to new migrants who travel here to australia on a family reunion visa and will they subsequently be separated from their relatives? alan tudge: no, that's certainly not the plan. i mean, typically most of the family reunions are australians who are marrying a foreigner and you obviously aren't going to send somebody to a different state. they have to obviously be together, but about 45 per cent of our migrants who come here, they don't have a geographical requirement as such. so there is opportunity to provide both incentives and indeed conditions to go elsewhere. sylvia jeffreys: okay. minister alan tudge, it certainly sounds like there's a lot more to be nutted out in terms of the plan there. we appreciate your time and you joining us this morning. thank you very much. alan tudge: thanks very much. "], "abc-radio-sydney-interview-wendy-harmer-and-robbie-buck": ["09 October 2018", "robbie buck: well, if you're driving around this morning, it's school holidays, and the traffic's not as bad as it could be. but of course, on a regular morning, around about this time, let's face it, sydney inner congestion can be pretty tough to get around. wendy harmer: right, and you think about how many new apartments are being built in this town. some people say sydney is full. robbie buck: well, when the debate is had, quite often the numbers of immigration and people coming to australia, and particularly coming to places like sydney, is always brought up. well, later on today, the federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure, and population, alan tudge, will deliver a speech in melbourne, looking at all of those issues including a plan which would make new- well, including a plan which would compel new visa recipients, new migrants, to live in regional australia for a number of years. the idea of forcing, or at least, encouraging new migrants to regional australia isn't new, but the key of course is how to monitor the movement of people. how would it work? alan tudge joins us now on abc radio sydney. good morning. alan tudge: good morning robbie. good morning wendy. wendy harmer: i guess what we need to know here, minister, what are the incentives? what are the carrots, and what are the sticks here? how are you going to encourage or compel people to move? alan tudge: yeah, if i could just step back one second, the essential problem which we've got which you've touched on is that we've got very fast population growth in a city like sydney, and also here in melbourne where i'm from, and yet very slow growth in the rest of australia, when often they're crying out for more people. so our overall objective is to try to get a better distribution of that growth. now, a big part of the growth, certainly in sydney and melbourne, is driven by migration. most migrants want to go to those two big cities. and so, one of the elements of our plan is to look at providing encouragements and indeed some conditions for new arrivals in the future to go to some of those smaller states or a regional area, which supports those areas and takes pressure off the big cities. robbie buck: can we talk just about the numbers, because the bureau of statistics has put out a lot of the figures when it comes to immigration into australia since- i mean, i noticed the article today goes back to 1982. take us through the ebb and flow when it comes to raw numbers coming into australia. alan tudge: yeah, so we've had very significant increase in the population growth since about 2007 when kevin rudd ratcheted up the migration intake. the migration intake has come off slightly over the subsequent ten years, but we still have very rapid population growth of about 1.6 per cent per annum across the country. in a city like sydney it's actually about 1.9 per cent per annum, which is very rapid growth by international standards, it's even faster in melbourne. so, as i said, the ambition is if we can just slightly ease the pressure on melbourne and sydney, and encourage people to go to those smaller states such as south australia where the premier has said to me he wants more people, then i think we support south australia as well as ease the congestion in sydney. robbie buck: okay. wendy harmer: well, that is quite true minister. on a recent trip to country south australia there were so many towns that seemed to be on their last legs, and not enough population to go around. but let's get to the nitty gritty of this, how can we encourage\u2014using your word there\u2014folk to go to live in those towns. alan tudge: yeah, let me just address that point though first wendy. there are places around australia which are absolutely crying out for more people right now. south australia is one of them, and in places like dubbo in new south wales is another where you've got 2.7 per cent unemployment, they cannot find workers right now. and yet you've got sydney going gangbusters. now, how can you encourage people to go to those regional areas or a smaller state? you can do that through a number of mechanisms through the migration program. for example, we already do provide additional points if you apply through the points-based system, to go to particular states or a regional area. we can look at that. you can then place conditions upon people's visas, if you like, and we place conditions upon a lot of visas, for a person to stay in a smaller state or a regional area for a few years, and in that time, the evidence would suggest that they'll make it their home, because their kids will start going to school and they'll get established jobs, et cetera. robbie buck: okay, that's the carrot, what about the stick? i mean, can you compel people to go and move to regional areas, or to other areas, if they come to australia- i mean, you're looking at five years i thought. can you compel them to stay in that place for five years? alan tudge: well you can place conditions upon people's visas, and there's all sorts of conditions placed upon visas generally. i mean, if somebody comes in and they're sponsored by an employer, the condition of that visa will be they maintain that job. and if they haven't got that job, then they'll have to leave the country. so, it's not unusual to place conditions upon visas, and indeed you can place geographic conditions. of course, once you're a citizen, i mean, you could live wherever you like, but until that time, you are able to place some reasonable conditions, and that's what we're looking at there. i should say that this is just one element of the plan, by the way. i know that we're focused on this, but the overall aim is to try to ease the pressure on a city like sydney, which is growing very fast. migration is one element. fast rail is another. supporting the economic development of some of the regions is a third element, and perhaps most importantly, which i'm outlining today as well, is just an overall better planning framework, so that we are better matching our population growth and distribution of that growth with our infrastructure expenditure and services expenditure. and that's perhaps the most critical part. wendy harmer: are you confident that you have the mechanisms to be able to track these people? alan tudge: yeah, i am confident about that, there's all sorts of things already today where in essence you have to provide your address. i mean, even for things like voting for example, i mean, it's connected to your residential address, so it's not too difficult. robbie buck: okay, and what kind of percentage of new immigrants are we looking at would have to fulfil those requirements? what sort of figures? alan tudge: i haven't specified that just yet, and there's more detail to come in relation to this. but at the moment, about 88 per cent of all skilled migrants come to melbourne and sydney. and a city like sydney, nearly all of the growth is due to migrant growth. and so even if you get a small percentage of that migration growth in the future, going into a smaller state like south australia, it will make a difference just to ease that pressure on the city. wendy harmer: minister, of course the reason why people do gravitate to the cities and they gravitate to their cultural group is to have some support while they get settled in. how will you provide that support for people who are being sent to, what sounds like, quite remote areas? alan tudge: well look, it is still what we're talking about in the future is people's choice. now, at the moment for example wendy, you can already get additional points as i mentioned for going into a regional area, people exercise their choice in doing that. and that would be the case in the future as well. so, can you have support there? well, even if- even a city like adelaide is becoming more multicultural. of course, when they're employer sponsored migrations, that's geographically bound, that obviously has to be where the employer is. with family reunion, it's typically when you're marrying a spouse, and obviously you have to be in the same place as that person you might be sponsoring in to be your spouse, but for 45 per cent of our migration intake, it's not really geographically connected, and so there are opportunities to provide further encouragements to reside in the smaller states. robbie buck: alright, well we might see how it floats with our listeners this morning. the number here, 1300 222 702. i'd love to hear from you and particularly if you are a recent migrant to australia too and what your thoughts are about this plan. of course, alan tudge will be delivering the plan later on today at the menzies research centre. wendy harmer: some people will say, minister, that you're- well, i guess you're using new migrants as a bit of a scapegoat here, or pawns in what others, what could be said, is a failure of the government to adequately plan for decentralisation, including things like fast rail. alan tudge: yeah, well i'm certainly not blaming migrants. i'm suggesting that in fact in the speech i outline why we've got the congestion problems today that we have, and that they're greater than what they should be. and it's in part because in 2007, kevin rudd ratcheted up the population growth unexpectedly. and then also, we didn't have the infrastructure being built for the planned population growth, let alone the turbocharged population growth. and that means we're in a bit of a catch-up phase. now, in a place like sydney, you can see infrastructure being built right across the city, in large part supported by federal government. now that means in a couple of years' time, the city's going to flow much, much more smoothly. but in the future, we have to have a better planning framework to your point, wendy, and that's exactly what we're planning on doing. wendy harmer: and will you be working with social services here, because i know our listeners are going to ask, are they going to be having english lessons and support for education and so forth. i mean, it's not just a numbers game, of just moving people from here to there, obviously. alan tudge: no, and again, just let me be clear too. we're talking about people arriving into the country in the future. wendy harmer: okay. alan tudge: so, you're coming from another destination, and you're choosing to reside in south australia rather than in sydney. second, a place like adelaide is a pretty big city today, wendy. there's all sorts of services there, you can get your english language training should you need it. robbie buck: alright, alan tudge, thanks so much for your time this morning. alan tudge: thanks very much wendy, thank you. wendy harmer: thank you, bye-bye. robbie buck: the minister for cities, urban infrastructure, and population, alan tudge.

alan tudge: yeah, i'm aware of the north-south corridor generally, and obviously we want to see the whole project completed. just at the last budget a few months ago we actually put in an additional $1.3\u00a0billion towards it to get the next stages done. now, there's got to be a lot of planning work completed first, the business cases to be done. but then we have got that large sum of money ready to be disposed towards the next stages. compere: that wouldn't even scratch the surface, would it? $1.2\u00a0billion. alan tudge: well, let's have a look what the business cases say, and what the various options are. i mean, i've just caught the back-end then of your interview with stephan knoll and he's saying there's various options to look at, tunnelling is one option, maybe there's other options as well, but that's why you do the detailed planning work. to work out how much these things cost, what the staging should be, and then you get on with it. obviously there has to be a state contribution, as well as the federal contribution, but we've worked together very well so far, we want to continue to do that. compere: from an infrastructure point of view, how important is south australia? alan tudge: oh, it's still very important. you know, we've invested i think close to $5\u00a0billion now since we first came to government a few years ago, and just put in another $1.8\u00a0billion in the recent budget. so, they're very significant sums of money. south australia is not growing as quickly as some of the other big cities, or the other states, but nevertheless, you've still got congestion-related issues which we want to address. i'm just about to go with nicolle flint actually down to see the oaklands precinct, that's another big project which she's been backing very strongly and it'll be completed next year. those types of things make a big difference to local residents. compere: are you aware of globelink? alan tudge: i have been briefed in relation to globelink, but i wouldn't say i'm across the details. i know that's a very large project, probably in the billions in terms of getting the rail to go around the outskirts of the city rather than through it. compere: so, is that the sort of thing that if premier steven marshall when he meets with you later on today, if he's really keen, today's the day to bring it up? alan tudge: oh, we have ongoing discussions between the state and federal ministers and with the premier, and i'll be sitting down with him today to talk about all sorts of matters including the adelaide city deal, and his aspirations for the hospital precinct down there. other infrastructure projects which we have underway presently. he [inaudible] be raising this as well in terms of a long-term project which may be put on the agenda. i'll be catching up also with stephan knoll, as he indicated before. and also going up to the adelaide hills and meeting up with the mount barker mayor and ceo, as well as georgina downer and just finding out what some of the local projects up there are on their priority list to see what we might be able to do in that area too. compere: did you bring your check book with you? alan tudge: [laughs] we've already got a lot of money on the table for south australia, and i've talked about that already. i should point out in addition, we do have a billion dollar urban congestion fund, and- which we want to deploy over the months and years ahead. and that fund is specifically to address some of these real localised pinch points. sometimes there are only, it's the one intersection which really holds up the traffic, that if you can fix, it makes a big difference to people's lives. so, we've got that funding there as well. and i want to have a discussion also with mr knoll about that. compere: minister we've just got a text from peter malinauskas, the leader of the opposition here in south australia. he says that $1.2\u00a0billion that you've referred to for south road is absolutely not in the forward estimates of the federal budget. it's off in the never never. is that correct? is it locked in for federal spending over the next three, four years, or is it a promise which means [audio skip] well, we'll negotiate with whoever's running the country after the next election? alan tudge: no, these things are in the forward budget. now, at the last budget, we outlined ten-year horizons, in terms of the projects which we wanted to fund and support in the long-term. and it's important to do that, because some of the very large-scale projects do take a couple of years in the planning before we can actually get them done. so, i haven't got the exact numbers in front of me in terms of where that sits, but it is locked into our forward projections. we want to get that project done. we've already spent a lot of money on this project, in consultation with the state government. we know it's a priority for south australia. compere: alan tudge, thank you. minister for cities, urban infrastructure, and population, here on\u2026 alan tudge: [interrupts] thanks very much. compere: \u2026here on abc radio adelaide.

alan tudge: my assessment is that it's still going exceptionally well. now, this is a pretty tough intervention as you know, because everybody on income support payments is issued with this cashless welfare card and that card as you know, it looks and works like any other visa card but it doesn't work at the bottle shop, it doesn't work at the gambling houses and you can't take cash out from it which means you can't purchase drugs and other illicit substances. and the impact on the ground is quite extraordinary in ceduna, in the other places where it's been rolled out in addressing that\u2014particularly the alcohol abuse which as you know just underpins much of the crime, so much of the dysfunction in these areas and it's not- this card is not a panacea. it was never intended to be so. but i think it is having quite a profound impact on the ground and i would hate to see it withdrawn prematurely. david penberthy: was the plan to roll it out into other locations as well? alan tudge: yeah, we've now got it rolled out fully into three locations and we're just about to roll it out into the fourth location. the fourth one's interesting: it's in queensland, in bundaberg, hervey bay, which is almost a completely non-indigenous area and it will be the largest site as well. so that'll begin early next year, and we think that'll have a really profound impact there as well. the interesting thing about that area is that you've got very high youth unemployment at the same time as you have thousands of backpackers going to bundaberg to do the entry level jobs. david penberthy: they're picking the fruit and so on. alan tudge: to pick the fruit. david penberthy: yeah. alan tudge: and it is so frustrating to have that situation where the businesses can't say they- the businesses say i can't get an aussie to do the job and meanwhile you've got 23.5 per cent youth unemployment. david penberthy: [indistinct] alan tudge: so hopefully the card will create a further incentive for those young people to actually take the jobs that are available. david penberthy: yeah, absolutely. alan tudge: and keith pitt, the local member there, has been very strong in terms of supporting the roll out there. i hope it has an impact like it has in the other areas. will goodings: we were having a conversation before you came in the program minister, about housing affordability in australia and housing prices have taken a rather dramatic turn on the eastern seaboard downward. are you comfortable with the trajectory of house prices in australia at the moment? alan tudge: the- certainly in melbourne and sydney house prices were very high and we probably needed to ease the pressure off the house prices just steadily. and that has been the case in melbourne and sydney where it has come off. i know here in adelaide the prices have still held up. the real risk that we see to be honest is, is if labor gets in and introduces- or abolishes the negative gearing policy, what will that do to house prices? and we're concerned it could actually have quite a very significant impact on house prices which not only impacts people's assets, but it has- can have corollary impacts on the economy at large and that's what we're most concerned about. david penberthy: one of the big drivers of housing affordability and one of the big variables in that whole equation is population. we've been fascinated by comments you've made about regional centres and directing new immigrants to different areas around australia and where adelaide and south australia fits in in that? we're not a centre as large as sydney or melbourne. are we technically regional and as such, in your view should we receive an influx of new migrants? alan tudge: we'll certainly i've been speaking to premier marshall about this and he would like to see south australia to be- to grow faster and bigger. we've got a fast-growing population in australia but nearly all the growth is in the three big capitals in melbourne, sydney, brisbane. in my home city of melbourne, we grew by 2.7 per cent last year off a big base. you guys grew by about 0.8 per cent. in absolute terms, that means you grew by 10,000 people last year. in melbourne we grew about 10,000 people every 28 days. right? so- and that puts enormous pressure on a city like melbourne whereas in somewhere like south australia arguably you can grow faster and so if we can get a better distribution of that migration growth and the population growth, then i think we both take the pressure off melbourne, but also assists adelaide to grow faster, create more opportunities for you, and improve your overall economic base. david penberthy: but is the political problem in terms of the sell job that the sentiment among a lot of people here in adelaide where we look to the east and go we don't want to end up that crowded? alan tudge: yeah but i think there's also great opportunities when you have a slightly larger population as you know, and i mean we have people from adelaide who still- who might leave the city and go east for the further opportunities which are available in a bigger city. now if you're slightly bigger here, then you're going to have more of those opportunities here for young people to stay in adelaide or stay in south australia and grow the place, make it a more vibrant city, it's already terrific and every year it's getting better. so that's the opportunity here. now we want to do it steadily. we want to do it in cooperation with the state government obviously and the local mayors. but they're the types of things which we are looking at. david penberthy: let us know what you think folks, 0448 083 095. minister alan tudge, thank you so much for coming in. alan tudge: thanks very much dave. thanks will. david penberthy: cheers. "], "2gb-interview-ray-hadley": ["02 October 2018", "ray hadley:\u00a0 i've spoken previously to alan tudge the federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population. now, last time we spoke to minister tudge it was about australia's population hitting 25\u00a0million. you remember we hit 25\u00a0million 33 years early and on the current trajectory, australia will hit 38\u00a0million by 2050. now, the minister is spending time specifically in queensland over the next two days. i wanted to talk to him about queensland, about what they want to do there. i noted in weekend publications, which i shared with my listeners yesterday on the public holiday, that property prices in brisbane, particularly south eastern queensland, have held pretty solid. in fact, they're up fractionally. i also read sydney has dropped by 6.1 per cent, which would make all those builders of those units across north-western, south-western, western sydney i would imagine rather nervous. but we'll focus on queensland today because the minister is in queensland. he's on the line. minister, good morning. alan tudge: good morning, ray. ray hadley: i guess you're up there taking a look at some of the areas that might need some federal attention. alan tudge: yeah that's right. so i'm largely in the area south of brisbane right now in the logan area, further south towards the gold coast and it's been a very rapidly growing area from a population perspective. and we're putting in a lot of money from an infrastructure point of view to address some of the congestion down here. ray hadley: i'm a regular user of the m1, either travelling from the gold coast to brisbane, vice versa. i have to say in the main it's not a bad road, but you get to those bottlenecks, you know, around springwood i just mentioned and south of brisbane around logan where it's reduced in capacity quite dramatically. is that the areas you're looking at specifically? alan tudge:yeah that's right. in fact, i've just been right there at the m1/m3 interchange and we're putting a couple of hundred million dollars there to basically widen the freeway because at the moment that interchange effectively has five lanes going into three and becomes a massive bottleneck when you're going southbound. so, by 2020 they'll be fixed and you'll be able to more seamlessly go south then we'll be duplicating the road going north as well but you will get much better traffic going north-south from brisbane all the way down to the gold coast. ray hadley: i noticed a story today in the courier mail saying these queensland cities are coping remarkably well in the face of rapid population growth, according to the grattan institute, rather than road network grinding to a halt commute levels have barely changed in five years to 2016, that's despite the rising population both north of brisbane and south of brisbane. and the other thing that's good news that was reported in the courier mail today as well is that house prices in that south-eastern quarter, the heavily populated part of queensland, they're holding up as opposed to what's happening in both melbourne and sydney. alan tudge: yeah, the- certainly melbourne and sydney, the house prices have come off pretty dramatically, as you know particularly in sydney. [\u2026] fortunately the house prices are holding up though, in south east queensland from the looks of things. ray hadley: what about rail? i mean, whenever i hear from my queensland listeners, particularly the city rail network seems to not cope and that is sometimes maladministration by those in charge. what about that, constant dramas in that part of queensland? alan tudge: yeah. we need to both invest in road and rail, ray. [audio glitch], sydney, south east queensland, no matter where you are. and often people sort of say it's not a one or the other but it's actually both that you need. you do need those mass transit systems. there has been good investment across all of those three cities in rail, and more needs to be done. but the population is growing so quickly in those three big cities\u2014in melbourne, sydney and brisbane\u2014that we do need to constantly invest in infrastructure. we've got a-billion-dollar congestion busting fund to try to fix some of the localised pinch points and they're some of the other things which i'm looking at while i'm up here in brisbane. but there's certainly a lot more work to do. ray hadley: i notice that there's a bit of a blow up from both the gold coast council and the queensland labor government, particularly the transport minister mark bailey. i was on the gold coast last week and you've got this light rail link, put in place for all intents and purposes for the commonwealth games and beyond, but now they want to have funding guaranteed for the broadbeach to burleigh link further south. now, they say it's been allocated but they say the prime minister may have gone cold on the idea. can you enlighten us? alan tudge: that's minister bailey playing a bit of politics there. listen, we've got nothing to announce at this stage, when we do have something to announce, we will do so. there was information which was leaked out to the media, that's all it was, it was just leaks. i think minister bailey\u2014who i'm catching up with later today\u2014just needs to take a chill pill, stop playing the politics, and let us get on with the job of trying to address some of these issues. ray hadley: okay. do you deal- in that sense is that a project that you would take over in concert with the government or does the gold coast city council play a role in all of this as well? alan tudge: in all of these projects, we work very closely with the state government and in the case of queensland, obviously with the local governments as well on these projects. we've already put a lot of money into that light rail project and there's been speculation in the media that we'll be funding stage three but it's just speculation. and as i said, i'll be catching up with minister bailey to discuss a number of projects in south east queensland this afternoon as to what further needs to be done up here. ray hadley: alright then. thanks for your time, alan, i appreciate it. alan tudge: thanks very much, ray. ray hadley: all the best. that's alan tudge, minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, in south eastern queensland this morning.\u00a0 "], "3aw-drive-interview-tom-elliot": ["02 October 2018", "tom elliot: alright, the daily commute\u2014i was amazed when i read this\u2014but the grattan institute, a supposedly independent think tank has said that since 2004; half of melburnians still only commute 30 minutes a day to work; 90 per cent of us travel more than an hour and that notwithstanding population growth which has been immense in this city, it has had a benign impact on both commute times and the distances people travel to get to and from their place of employment. i find this hard to believe. joining me on the line now, the federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population\u2014he is a melburnian\u2014alan tudge, good evening. alan tudge: g'day, tom. tom elliot: what did you think about the grattan institute's conclusions? did you think our commute times have stayed steady since 2004? alan tudge: well it certainly surprised me, but i think what they've been saying is that people inevitably- they drop out of their job, they move house or they do other things to try to avoid congestion, and of course, we've had a lot of [indistinct] population coming into the inner city as well, which means that their commute times are very small and that brings down the average. certainly melburnians know that we've got very serious congestion on our roads and i think you'd have to be silly to say that we don't and that's why we're investing so much money on the major infrastructure to try to address some of that congestion. tom elliot: okay. so i mean, you're the minister, as we said, for cities, urban infrastructure and population, so you therefore acknowledge congestion is a problem. what are you going to do about it? alan tudge: well the few things we're going to do about it. one: we're investing records amount in infrastructure. so for example, people traveling on the monash would have already known that that's been upgraded and that's thanks in part due to some federal money there. we've still got money where we want to get the east west link built; we want to continue to work on the m80 and other important pieces of rail as well. on top of that, though, we do have to try to get a broader distribution of population growth across the country, because melbourne has been growing very, very fast, as you pointed out tom, and yet there's other parts of the country who are crying out for more workers and want to grow more rapidly. and so if we can support places like south australia to grow more rapidly and slow down the growth a little bit, it will take pressure off melbourne, then we can help melbourne as well as help south australia. tom elliot: [interrupts] well couldn't you do something like speak to your colleague christopher pyne, who's a south australian, and just say: righto, for the next couple of years, every immigrant to this country must go and live in adelaide and its surrounds. well, wouldn't that solve the problem that melbourne and sydney find themselves in? alan tudge: well one of the things we are going to look at is whether or not we can require migrants to go to some of the regional areas or the smaller states, because at the moment they nearly all come to melbourne and sydney. most of the growth\u2014the population growth in melbourne\u2014has been due to international migration. now, there are things that we can do and we're working on this. at the same time, we do need to be a bit careful because there's businesses who want to sponsor people into the country because they simply can't find australians to do the jobs and we want to make sure that they can, of course, continue to grow their businesses when they can't find an australian to do it. tom elliot: alright, thank you so much. alan tudge, federal minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population. i apologise about the poor quality of that call. "], "abc-radio-brisbane-interview-rebecca-levingston-and-craig-zonca": ["02 October 2018", "rebecca levingston: did you know we have a federal minister in charge of cities? and today he is in your city. alan tudge is touring brisbane, he's the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population. minister, good morning. who are you hoping to run in to today? alan tudge: so, i'm spending a couple of days here largely in the south of brisbane, down at brisbane's bayside, logan and down towards the gold coast, and with a couple of the local members, bert van manen and ross vasta, looking at congestion hotspots down there. and they're lobbying for particular upgrades on roads and issues down there which are causing angst for people. craig zonca: does that mean you've brought your chequebook with you, minister? alan tudge: well, we're already spending over $5\u00a0billion in queensland at the moment to build major infrastructure including upgrades to the m1, as you probably know. but we've also got a billion dollar urban congestion fund which we want to be allocating and largely to those very small hotspots which can be the local intersection which keeps people stuck for 10 minutes, we want to be able to fix those things because often they're a real bugbear and cause real traffic delays. rebecca levingston: you could have just spoken to our traffic guy, brad, he could tell you all the hotspots\u2026 alan tudge: [laughs] that's probably true. rebecca levingston: \u2026although i wonder if you've had time, as you made your way to brisbane this morning, to have a look at this grattan institute report that actually says over the last five-years commute times in capital cities haven't really changed much in terms of time or distance. alan tudge: yeah, i have had a quick look at that report, which has just been released this morning, and they're essentially saying that congestion isn't too much of a problem and i've got to say, i reckon they should get out and speak to some of the people in brisbane or on the gold coast to say that congestion hasn't been getting worse, because all the indications are that it has been. and even their report itself says on some occasions that the time spent in traffic is getting longer in some of our major capital cities. it is a real issue and that's why we're investing so much. craig zonca: when it comes to major infrastructure projects, of course, one that's happening in brisbane is cross river rail, fully funded by the state government at this stage. your predecessor, paul fletcher, wasn't the biggest fan of it, are you more of a fan, alan tudge, of cross river rail? alan tudge: listen, i don't have a problem with the cross river rail, it [inaudible] like it's a necessary project but the state government has fully funded it, so they don't need a federal contribution. we've got massive federal contributions towards other big infrastructure projects here in brisbane and queensland, $10\u00a0billion for example going towards the bruce highway, over a-billion-dollars going towards the m1, upgrades to the brisbane metro, things like that. that's where our focus is. but i'm going to be catching up also with minister bailey, the transport minister today, as well and we'll have further discussions about future projects. craig zonca: so, you're saying you're a fan of cross river rail, if the state government came to you and said, look, we need some extra funding to ease the financial burden of making this project happen\u2014would you be receptive to that? alan tudge: well, when a project is already fully funded then, it's fully funded, they don't need a federal contribution. and i probably should say that queensland overall is getting over $500\u00a0million extra from the new share of gst distribution formula and [inaudible] use some of that money towards that, then of course that's up to the queensland government to do so. rebecca levingston: well, we'll see what the state treasurer makes of that when she and all the other state and territory treasurers meet with the federal treasurer tomorrow. one final question for you alan tudge, as the minister for cities, what's your favourite city in australia? alan tudge: [laughs] well, that's a tough question. i was born and bred in melbourne and so i'm naturally partial to that [inaudible] family but i have spent a bit of time up here in queensland. i lived up in far north queensland for a couple of years and love this state. but outside of melbourne [laughs], i don't think i better comment on that one. rebecca levingston: at least you're honest. appreciate your time. enjoy your stay in brisbane. alan tudge: thanks very much, rebecca. rebecca levingston: alan tudge, the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, visiting brisbane today and tomorrow. so, if you run into him, maybe put your hand up for some cash, point out some congestion hotspots or something else the city needs. craig zonca: well, that's what he says he wants to hear about; congestion hotspots and to access some of that money that is available to try to relieve those pinch points, and there are plenty of them around brisbane.

"], "2gb-mornings-interview-john-stanley": ["25 September 2018", "john stanley: it is so hard to get around the city and the constant complaint is congestion: too many people, too much development, we need to slow it down. you can say the same for brisbane. you can say the same for some of our regional areas but there are many other regional areas where people say well we'd actually like to have more people. if our population say was you know, instead of 10,000 if it was 15,000 you could add more. we'd have more people; we might be able to support a slightly larger business or a particular business that needs a certain number of people. weight of numbers to be able to support it and then when that business opens then everything just rolls on and the place starts to develop. so you get to the argument over population. you get to the argument over immigration and people say well can't we start to bring people in and send them to regional areas, then you open the lines and you hear people who say that when they came in in the 50s often you'd go in and live in a rural area for a couple of years and it's a lot easier today than it was then because these days you go to a regional area, you've got the internet, you have- there's very little that you don't have if you go to a regional area. the man who is presiding over all of this is alan tudge. he is the cities, urban infrastructure and population minister. his job has been characterised by scott morrison as being a congestion-buster and he's on the line with us now. alan tudge, good morning. alan tudge: good morning john. john stanley:\u00a0you saw that poll yesterday: more than 60 per cent of people in sydney want to restrict migration to the city. i'm sure that would apply also in brisbane. so how can you do that and how can you get more of those people to those regional areas where they say they need more people? alan tudge: you're exactly right and we're taking a good, close look at this because the essential challenge is that we've got three very fast growing, big capital cities in melbourne, sydney and south east queensland around brisbane and yet the rest of australia is growing quite slowly and often there are places which are actually crying out for more people. so the challenge for us is how do we get a better distribution of the population growth so that instead of everybody coming to those three big capitals, they're more evenly going across the country. one of the levers of course that we do have is in relation to migration and we're looking at whether or not we can create further incentives and indeed then further conditions upon new migrants to go to the smaller states, the smaller capitals or indeed to regional areas for at least a few years where hopefully they'll make it their home. john stanley:\u00a0now when you talk about, i mean you can't force people to stay in a particular place but you can place a condition. how does it work when you say you've got to go to this place and then to what extent do you determine where they go? alan tudge: yeah sure, so obviously when you're a citizen you can live wherever you like, that's part of being a citizen. but while you're still here on a visa, effectively we can place conditions upon that visa and we do that in multiple ways. so we can for example say that right, part of your entry into australia might be that you stay in south australia for at least a few years and that can be enforced and then hopefully during that time they actually grow to love south australia, they stay there, they work there, their kids go to the local school, they join the community and that would then help south australia to grow and take a bit of pressure off melbourne, sydney, and south east queensland. john stanley: so just to explain if i'm on air in south australia on 5aa which would be our equivalent in south australia, the conversation there is to get more people, that they want more people don't they? alan tudge:\u00a0absolutely it's a completely different conversation in south australia and that's sometimes what is missed from people who live in melbourne and sydney and south east queensland. you know i've been speaking to the premier of south australia and they're sort of saying please give us more people because last year south australia grew by 10,000. melbourne grew by 10,000 people every 25 days. john stanley:\u00a0and that's a similar number to sydney isn't it? you're talking a very similar number aren't you? alan tudge: just to put that in perspective and that's similar to sydney, melbourne was actually the fastest growing. sydney, almost as fast not quite and south east queensland not very far behind as well. so we want to work with people like the south australian premier steve marshall, who wants to grow adelaide, who wants to grow south australia both from a population perspective as well as from an economic perspective. same with chief minister gunner up in the northern territory and i spoke with him. they want to grow the population up in darwin because they've had slack growth up there for quite some time. so we want to work with him and same in regional parts of australia where sometimes they can't get a warm body to do the job. so there's real opportunities here to take the pressure off the big capitals and support the growth of the smaller states and the regional area. john stanley: and this is why for instance where in melbourne and sydney and brisbane where you've got big road projects being undertaken and people are thinking well what's the benefit going to be at the end and then you look at the numbers of new cars being put on the road every week. you're just basically catching up and then hospitals\u2014you have a brand new hospital, you give billions of dollars- big brand new shiny hospitals have been built, and you think well why are they still overcrowded? that's because they're only just keeping up with the increase in population. alan tudge: yeah certainly in relation to the roads and rail infrastructure: i think the infrastructure is finally catching up with the population growth and we've had very rapid population growth over the last decade which exceeded the expectations as well. so we're probably at a combination john, of population growth going faster than what was forecast and we probably didn't have enough infrastructure being spent you know between 10 and 20 years ago in anticipation of that growth. now having said that in 10 years in sydney as you know there's infrastructure being built right across the city and in a couple of years' time when a lot of that is completed, it will make a massive difference to sydney and we've got to continue to invest in that congestion-busting infrastructure but we've also got to work on the other couple of elements as well. that includes a stronger decentralisation agenda of that and that includes better planning agenda as well in terms of planning for the future in terms of where the population goes and marrying the infrastructure with the population growth. i think we can do better at that and that's certainly on my agenda. john stanley:\u00a0what about all the people listening to us right now in rural areas who are saying well, you throw some migrants our way and they're going to take the jobs of our kids and therefore it's going to be counterproductive? alan tudge: depends on where you are. now, you know obviously you don't want to put a whole stack of new people into an area which has high youth unemployment or where unemployment is generally high but there might be other places like dubbo for example where the unemployment rate is about 2 per cent. now they can't get enough workers to do the jobs which are available, so it's in locations like that where they might be able to take more people. but you want to do that in consultation with the local mayors and local councils out there. there's places in victoria i know, in say warrnambool in western victoria, they're crying out for a thousand workers right now for jobs which are going begging and they've been speaking to me saying how can we get either some of the melbourne population or new migrants to come out to that area rather than everybody going to the centre of melbourne. john stanley: yep, so the idea is new migrants because in the end if they're there for a couple of years, i mean life is pretty good in these place you've described. alan tudge: absolutely. john stanley: then they start to establish some roots and some connections and they know people. so that could work. what about trying to shift some people out of the cities to those areas? alan tudge: yeah we could work on that as well. and obviously we've had a big decentralisation agenda from the public services perspective for some time and that's helps to shift some jobs to some of those regional areas or satellite cities if you like, and there's other things which we could do on that front. there's also with the major cities, we can work on trying to create more jobs in the areas which people live so that they don't have to travel across the city for an hour at a time or an hour each way in order to get to work. now a good example of that is actually western sydney where we've got a good relationship with the local councils and the state government and trying to build- trying to create 200,000 jobs in western sydney. in the process we'll generate up to 200,000 houses and also put in the road and rail infrastructure to match and that means in the future, people will be able to live, work and play all within western sydney rather than having to jump on the major arterials to come into the cbd for work, so that benefits those residents of western sydney and it benefits the rest of sydney residents because the roads won't be as congested. so they're the types of things also that you can do, you've got a great model there in western sydney. john stanley: [interrupts] but you know that statement you just made where you talked about extra jobs which, sounds terrific, then you talk about 200,000 extra houses, numbers of houses and then people go really? because ultimately in sydney they just see more and more housing and they just connect that with more crush and more congestion and harder to get around the place. alan tudge: yeah i think- and i understand that. i particularly understand that with so much infrastructure works going on around the city at the moment people are really felling it because often when the infrastructure's being built, it may in fact make things worse for that short time before it becomes better. certainly when you look at the pipeline of when many of the projects are being completed you can see in the very near future that sydney is going to move much, much more seamlessly once a lot of these major projects such as westconnex is completed. john stanley: all right we'll see how all of that goes. couple of other things. we are going to talk to tony abbott a bit later in the program, of course your indigenous envoy but scott morrison, he is on the front page of the papers today talking about a separate day to mark our indigenous heritage from australia day. what do you think of that idea? alan tudge: yeah, i think it's worthwhile considering that. i mean\u2014scott morrison made a very strong statement that we are sticking to the 26th of january as australia day and we shouldn't mess with that. it was the beginning of modern australia and also as many people don't know, it was when the citizenship act first came into play on the 26th of january 1949, so it's an important day in that regard as well. can we also celebrate though our 60,000-year-old indigenous heritage and i think we should be doing that and it's worthwhile considering whether or not we have a separate day to specifically mark and celebrate the oldest, living, continuous culture on the planet. so the prime minister is open to ideas about how we might do that and what sort of day would be appropriate, but importantly it goes hand in glove with keeping australia day on the 26th of january. john stanley:\u00a0131873 is our number, 23 minutes to 10. just a final one i'll just ask you because you said yesterday that scott morrison's decisive, consultative and authentic. does that suggest that his predecessor might not have been quite all of those things? alan tudge: no, i wasn't suggesting that for nanosecond. every leader has their own attributes and i was making some comments about how well i think that scott morrison is going as prime minster. and i think he is going very well and i think people are liking what they're seeing. and i hope they give him a good opportunity to assess him because when they do assess him i think they'll like him. john stanley: and look i saw julie bishop was on 60 minutes on sunday night. were you disappointed that she didn't decide to stay on as foreign minister because she was given that offer, she was asked to stay on wasn't she? alan tudge: yeah ultimately it was her decision and i can understand her decision. i thought she was an excellent foreign minister over the last five years and- but she made that call, and it's her decision and now marise payne, a new south welshman, is the foreign minister and she'll equally do a great job. john stanley: alright. alan tudge, good to talk to you. thank you. alan tudge: thanks very much, john. john stanley: alan tudge there. he's minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population.

is it better or worse than it was? alan tudge: certainly, scott morrison is a very strong leader. he\u2019s decisive, he\u2019s consultative and i think he understands suburban australia and i think he\u2019s doing very well and i think the polling is indicating that. laura jayes: okay. yeah, we did see a newspoll today. you\u2019re still well behind though. can you [indistinct] next election?

alan tudge: i just think that scott is a very authentic individual. i think his instincts are good, he\u2019s a good decision maker and that he\u2019s leading a united team, and that\u2019s what we need. we need to stay united between now and the election and concentrate on the things which matter to the australian people. and i think he can also very clearly and articulately lay out the contrast with the labor party. now, the labor party, as you know, they want to put up taxes on almost everything that moves, whereas we want to lower taxes, make it easier for people and give people a sense of security. laura jayes: well just on that\u2014authenticity and instinct\u2014they\u2019re two things that are repeated by some of your colleagues. are they two things that malcolm turnbull just didn\u2019t have? alan tudge: oh listen, malcolm was a strong leader in and of himself. everybody comes with their own characteristics, but i\u2019m focusing on scott morrison as prime minister. laura jayes: [talks over] are you looking for authenticity and instinct at the top? alan tudge: oh laura, i\u2019m just not going to go into that. i mean, we\u2019ve\u2014scott morrison is prime minister, he\u2019s doing a great job in terms of leading our party and, as i said, i think the australian people is taking a good, close look at him and i think when they see him they are liking what they see, and it\u2019s nine months till the election. laura jayes: well let\u2019s talk about badgerys creek. the first sod was turned today. alan tudge: [talks over] it was. it was. laura jayes: [indistinct] we\u2019ve got the two thumbs up from action man, scott morrison. a couple of weeks ago he was lamenting to senior colleagues that there weren\u2019t projects and announcements ready to go. is this one of those announcements? did you do some quick work behind the scenes to get this done? alan tudge: no. this is a massive announcement today and this has been planned for some time, obviously, in terms of actually starting the project build, and this is going to mean 11,000 jobs in the short-term, about 28,000 jobs operationally. but importantly, it means a second airport for sydney, in western sydney, and it\u2019ll be a full-service airport from day one. what that means is you\u2019ll have the low-cost carriers as well as virgin and qantas, as well as international airlines from day one in 2026, and that means you\u2019ve got more choice as to which airport you want to go to, it means you\u2019ve got more convenience\u2014if it\u2019s more convenient to go there\u2014and because there\u2019ll be greater competition, that puts downward pressure on airlines prices as well, which is important. laura jayes: i was going to ask you about that because qantas and other major carriers have been complaining about the monopoly behaviour of sydney airport. does this solve all those problems in and of itself, or does there need to be more reform? is there a greater role for the accc, even with badgerys creek? alan tudge: well listen, the accc will always keep an eye on the economy more broadly, including airport policy, but this does provide important competition into the sydney market. importantly, it adds massive capacity, of course, because what will be opened in 2026 will be an airport the size of adelaide\u2019s airport\u201410 million passengers each year. and above and beyond that in the decades ahead a second runway will be added and eventually we may well get to an airport which is more the size of the larger united states airports. that\u2019s the scope and capacity which this site has. laura jayes: is that the problem, though, in 2026 having a capacity in western sydney of an airport the size of adelaide? i mean, western sydney is the third largest economy in australia. don\u2019t you need badgerys creek to have bigger capacity from the word go? alan tudge: not from the word go we don\u2019t, and there\u2019s been a lot of planning into this. but initially\u2026 laura jayes: why not? why not though? alan tudge: well initially there\u2019ll just be one airline\u2014one runway which is built, a 3.7 kilometre long runway, and it will be able to accommodate 10 million passenger movements initially.\u00a0 down the track we\u2019ll be building a second runway, and the forecasts are by 2060 it will be able to accommodate potentially up to about 80 million passengers, which is slightly bigger than los angeles airport. now, that\u2019s a long way into the future but we are thinking long-term. the short-term project though with $5 billion of federal money which this government put in place and got going, we\u2019ll build the single runway, open in 2026 with the rail connection, with freeway connection. this is a massive project that will be so good for sydney and so good for australia. laura jayes: it certainly will be. we\u2019re talking at a time though where population growth is a source of some anxiety within the population, particularly those in the big cities. you\u2019ve been talking about spreading that migration and the number of migrants. we had last year permanent intake of 160,000 in the last financial year. you\u2019ve spoken about getting more people to the regions. but how will that practically work? for example if you have a migrant family that goes out to dubbo and they start working for a big company and then they\u2014that company wants them to transfer to sydney, how do you stop that? alan tudge: there is\u2014we\u2019ve got\u2014the major population problem that we have is that nearly all the growth is in melbourne, sydney and south-east queensland. and there we have very rapid growth, and yet meanwhile the rest of australia is growing very slowly and so ideally we\u2019d have a broader distribution of that growth and then we wouldn\u2019t have the same type of pressures which those three big capitals are feeling right now. now, having said that\u2014and i\u2019ll get to your question\u2014but what we announced today with western sydney airport, which is part of a broader western sydney development actually assists with some of those congestion pressures as well because the idea is to create, in essence, a larger centre around western sydney where people will be able to work, live and play all in western sydney and that means they\u2019re not putting pressure on those major arterials. getting back to your question about migration though, yes we can put conditions on where people will work and will reside while they\u2019re on a visa. so visas\u2026 laura jayes: [talks over] so a visa class? but how would that visa class work? how can\u2014and is it geographical? alan tudge: in essence\u2014in essence until\u2026 laura jayes: [talks over] or does it have a line? alan tudge: well in essence laura whenever\u2014until someone\u2019s a citizen they\u2019re on a visa, and when they\u2019re on a visa you can attach conditions to them. now, we attach\u2026 laura jayes: [talks over] so how would you do that? alan tudge:\u2026 we attach all sorts of conditions already, including some people be sponsored into, say, south australia presently under one of the migration schemes. laura jayes: but is it state-by-state? i mean, it\u2019s easier when you have state lines\u2026 alan tudge: sure. laura jayes:\u2026 but how do you make it a regional city divide? alan tudge: well, we\u2019ll get there\u2026 laura jayes: oh, come on. give us the details, alan tudge. alan tudge: we\u2019ll get there, but certainly\u2014i mean, one of the states\u2014i was speaking to the south australian premier\u2026 laura jayes: but can you do that? i don\u2019t expect you to give me the detail now\u2014well, i do\u2014but\u2026 alan tudge: we can do that is the answer, laura. laura jayes: right, okay. alan tudge: but i\u2019ll just say this point. i mean, we\u2019re not just talking about the regions but we\u2019re talking about the smaller states because there\u2019s a state like south australia which only grew by 10,000 people last year. melbourne grew by 10,000 every 25 days. now, the south australian premier, i\u2019ve spoken to him. he wants to significantly grow south australia from a population perspective and including using migration as the lever. so we\u2019re working with him as we are with the chief minister of the northern territory, as we are with other premiers and chief ministers. laura jayes: so would you create special tax zones, so you have big corporations\u2026 alan tudge: that\u2019s not something on our agenda, no. laura jayes: no. why not? alan tudge: well, that would be up to the treasurer in any case but it\u2019s not on our agenda at the moment. laura jayes: it has been flagged in previous elections. i think kevin rudd did it. alan tudge: i think kevin rudd flagged that. i think it lasted about five or ten minutes then, i think laura. or what was it, half an hour [indistinct]. laura jayes: [talks over] it did, it did. but what\u2019s wrong\u2014what\u2019s wrong with the basic premise of it? alan tudge: it\u2019s not something which we\u2019re looking at laura in terms of different taxation arrangements. laura jayes: [talks over] because it just wouldn\u2019t work or do [indistinct]? alan tudge: i mean, we\u2019ve got one unified national taxation arrangement at the moment as you know. different states have different payroll tax arrangements. we want to see payroll tax go down, and some governments may want to do that. but we certainly have the overall ambition of trying to get a broader distribution of that population growth. laura jayes: okay. well, when will we see the details on this? before the end of the\u2026 alan tudge: [talks over] well, we\u2019re working on the policy at the moment laura, so you may well see some things by the end of the year. certainly it will be well before the election. laura jayes: okay. alan tudge, thanks so much for your time today. alan tudge: thanks laura.

i mean that's eight years. i mean i would imagine if an airport like this was being built in china it wouldn't take them eight years and i think our friends up at toowoomba built one up there in a very quick amount of time. what\u2026 alan tudge: yeah, this is a huge undertaking and you've got to understand that the runway itself is 3.7\u00a0kilometres long and we're building an airport to be the size of adelaide's airport initially and it's not just the airport but it's all the associated infrastructure around it. so by the time the airport is actually open in 2026 we'll have the m12 built and that will connect the m7 directly to the airport. we'll have a rail link built so that you can get on the train and continue on from st mary's down to the airport immediately from the first stage that the airport opens. so it's a huge amount of work to be done between now and then. we're on track. the bulldozers are there ready to get going and we want to get this thing underway. steve price: what's your feeling as to who will be the main users of badgerys as compared to kingsford smith? i mean are we talking about full service airlines flying in and out of there? i know there's going to be no curfew, so you're going to have international and domestic flights in and out of this airport when it starts? alan tudge: yeah, that's exactly right. it's going to be the international and domestic airline. and i think one of your concerns, steve, was that it might have just been for the discount airlines and that's not the case. in fact virgin and qantas have already indicated that they'll have full premium domestic services operating from day one in 2026. so, this is a full-service airport. the size of adelaide and will cater are 10\u00a0million passengers and it will grow from there and of course as everybody knows the kingsford smith airport is pretty congested already. it's reaching capacity and that's exactly why we do need this second airport. steve price: yeah well, i use it weekly and you can add, as you know because you travel a lot by air, you can at least half an hour to every journey just by taxing times at sydney airport. but consumers will have a choice presumably. you'll be able to fly from melbourne or adelaide or perth or wherever you're coming from and you'll be able to book to either get out of badgerys or get out at kingsford smith. alan tudge: yep, that's exactly right. so that's good for consumers to have that choice and when you've got a bit of competition between the airports as well that tends to put down the pressure on prices too. so it's more convenient for consumers and it will lead to lower prices for consumers as well. steve price: so it's a project costing $5.3\u00a0billion, how's that split up between federal and state governments? alan tudge: that's all federal contributions. it's a federally funded airport and that's over 10 years. now, that's a big contribution of funding and on top of that there's about $3.6\u00a0billion worth of infrastructure funding. so, it's a huge undertaking, not just for the airport but for broader western sydney and in the process it's going to be a massive jobs boost for western sydney as well as i said. eleven thousand jobs just in the construction phase and a further 26,000, 27,000 jobs in the operations phase and [audio cuts out]\u2026 steve price: you might have lost\u2026 alan tudge: [indistinct] are you still there, steve?

"], "new-research-internal-migration-covid-19-impacts": ["19 December 2020", "a new research paper from the federal government\u2019s centre for population shows australia is experiencing unprecedented interstate migration trends as a result of the pandemic. titled \u2018anticipating the impact of covid-19 on internal migration\u2019, the research from experts at the university of queensland indicates a downturn in the number of people moving interstate. the centre for population has forecast that the number of people moving interstate is expected to fall by 12 per cent in 2020-21, the lowest rate on record. the number of people moving around the country is expected to recover as the effects of covid-19 lessen. from 2023-24, the level of interstate migration is expected to return to the 20-year average. with net overseas migration effectively on hold, internal migration will be the main driver of changes to australia\u2019s population distribution. the research also shows an extraordinary reversal in migration patterns is expected in melbourne and victoria as a result of the extended lockdown. victoria is now expected to see more people leaving the state relative to other jurisdictions despite usually seeing people move in. for the first time in over a decade, there is now evidence that people are leaving victoria, and melbourne in particular. . recent abs regional migration data released in november showed victoria had a net loss of people to other states in the june quarter for the first time since june 2008, and melbourne losing an astounding 11,000 people in the year to date, ten times as many people who left in the previous year. the findings come off the back of the inaugural population statement, released last month, which found people are in fact less likely to make an internal move during times of economic uncertainty, matching what we have seen in previous downturns. the modelling shows a 1 per cent decline in gdp per capita leads to a 1.5 per cent drop in the rate of interstate migration. the modelling also shows that migration between capital cities and regions responds to changes in economic conditions, particularly the relative unemployment rate and relative house prices. for example, the research shows if the unemployment rate rises in capital cities when compared with regional areas, migration to the regions increases. it also shows if house prices increase in regional areas compared to capital cities, migration to the regions will fall. the centre for population forecasts almost all states are likely to see a short-term shift of internal migration patterns away from capital cities toward regional areas due to the covid-19 pandemic. early data released by the abs shows capital cities had a net loss of 10,500 people to regional areas in the quarter to june 2020, the largest net quarterly move to the regions on record. this is more than double the average observed over the last 10 years. however, the projections show that as the economy recovers, capital cities will recover to higher growth rates than regional areas, with regional internal migration assumed to return to the 10-year average for each capital city and regional area in each state. the research paper is available at www.population.gov.au. the centre\u2019s population statement is available at www.population.gov.au/statement and includes more detail on state, territory (page 60) and regional (page 71) population forecasts. minister tudge \u2013 michael bennett 0434 782 923 "], "progress-carrick-hill-pavilion": ["18 December

declined sharply during the covid-19 pandemic, with 1.1\u00a0million fewer people making up our population by 2031 than previously expected, according to the first annual population statement released today. the statement is the first of its kind to be produced by the federal government\u2019s centre for population and provides the most comprehensive analysis of population trends and projections in our history. the statement shows population growth in 2020-21 will be the slowest since world war i. negative net migration is also forecast for the first time in 75 years this year and next. australia\u2019s population growth is projected to rebound strongly by 2023-24, but not return to previously expected levels of growth until 2027-28. australia\u2019s population is expected to reach 28 million in 2028-29, three years later than would have been reached in the absence of covid-19. melbourne is forecast to overtake sydney as australia\u2019s largest capital city in 2026-27. this is primarily due to sydney\u2019s continuing slowing population growth, with negative growth now forecast for the first time since 1952-53. this follows evidence that more people will leave victoria, and melbourne in particular, relative to other jurisdictions in the short term due to the second wave of covid-19 and intense extended lockdown. the impact of covid-19 and the associated migration restrictions have the smallest impact on queensland\u2019s population growth, with strong interstate migration into queensland expected. south australia\u2019s population growth will be zero this year before recovering in subsequent years. the statement finds that whilst sydney and melbourne will have the sharpest fall in population growth in the short term due to the slowing of overseas migration, population growth will pick up again. population growth in regional australia will be less affected than in our capital cities and we are already seeing early evidence that more people are choosing to call regional australia home, disrupting long-term trends. capital cities had a net loss of 10,500 people to regional areas in the quarter to june 2020, the largest net quarterly move to the regions on record. this is more than double the average observed over the last ten years, and supports the government\u2019s policy aim of a more evenly balanced population distribution. the statement also shows that covid-19 will be partially responsible for the faster ageing of australia\u2019s population, as australians put off having children and fewer young migrants enter australia in the short term due to international border restrictions. the median age in australia is now projected to be 40 in 2031. the pre-covid-19 estimate was 39. the slower population growth and faster ageing will directly impact our economic growth. this underscores the importance of the government\u2019s unprecedented $507 billion covid-19 support and recovery package, which has provided timely support to keep australians in work, and businesses in business. this includes record levels of investment into infrastructure. while population growth in our big cities has declined, infrastructure investment has increased providing an opportunity for these cities to catch up on infrastructure needs. the government is committed to ensuring australia emerges from the pandemic with a stronger, more resilient economy. the first annual population statement is available at www.population.gov.au. the population statement is produced by the australian government\u2019s centre for population which was established in july 2019. the statement is the first of its kind and provides the most comprehensive analysis and projections of australia\u2019s population. developed in consultation with states and territories, and the australian local government association, the statement examines how australia\u2019s population will change over the next decade, in particular highlighting the effects of covid-19 on population growth and distribution. access to high-quality, transparent and easy-to-understand population data is now more important than ever. understanding the vastly different dynamics of our states and territories, and cities and regions is crucial for effective planning and decision-making. this is true for both the public and private sectors in areas like infrastructure, planning, housing, and access to the essential services australian rely on. the statement also delivers on a key commitment made by the prime minister, state and territory ministers, and the australian local government association, as agreed in the national population and planning framework in february 2020. significant progress in aligning population projections across all states and territories was also announced today, with a national agreement achieved on five core principles. this will ensure greater consistency and transparency of population projections across the country,

governments are working together on a $100 million transformation of thomas road in perth's south eastern suburbs. the busy road, that runs through perth's booming south eastern suburbs, is used by thousands of commuters daily and more than $100 million has been allocated for upgrades that will improve safety and efficiency. $30 million of additional funding has been allocated to upgrades at the intersection of thomas road and kargotich road in oakford. originally, this intersection upgrade was earmarked as a single lane roundabout with $3 million allocated through the black spots program. the additional funding means an extra $6 million has been allocated to the project, upgrading the roundabout from a single lane to a dual lane, with work to commence next year. the remainder of the funds will be used to undertake a range of safety improvements, including $5 million towards the installation of street lighting as well as low cost shoulder widening works on thomas road between cumming road and tonkin highway, which have been shown to greatly reduce the chance of crashes. upgrades will be undertaken at the intersection of thomas road and nicholson road, with a new two lane roundabout to be installed to improve safety and traffic efficiency for the 19,000 vehicles that pass through the intersection daily. early works are underway on the construction of a new bridge on thomas road over the existing rail corridor. this will be the first level crossing between armadale and byford to be reconfigured to accommodate the long anticipated metronet byford rail extension. the thomas road over rail bridge will include two lanes in each direction and will facilitate the extension of the armadale line by around 8km down to byford. the $52 million project is expected to be completed towards the end of 2022 and has been fast tracked to assist with western australia's economic recovery from covid-19. in addition, planning is also progressing to provide a dual carriageway on the one-kilometre section of thomas road immediately east of kwinana freeway, in anticipation of a commercial sector development that will create and support local jobs. these works will commence in late 2021. on top of this $100 million, more than $500 million has been allocated to extend tonkin highway from thomas road in oakford to south western highway, south-east of mundijong. this will provide improved access to growing residential areas, industry, the airport and the freeway. extensive planning and development work is well underway with construction to start in late 2021 subject to environmental and statutory approvals. safety improvement upgrades on a busy 4.3km section of thomas road, between kwinana freeway and cumming road in anketell were completed in the first half of the year. improvement works\u00a0included shoulder widening and resurfacing along with the installation of new line markings and raised road pavement markers. the upgrades significantly improved safety for road users on this stretch of road, which has seen 114 reported crashes in the five years to december 2019. road planning is also underway to help develop the potential long-term future of the thomas and anketell road freight corridor, from the proposed kwinana outer harbour site to tonkin highway. premier mark mcgowan said his government was focused on delivering tangible benefits and upgrades for those living in the south-eastern suburbs. \"my government's number one priority has always been local jobs and this transformation of thomas road will provide numerous employment opportunities as well as benefits to local businesses, supporting our economy through covid-19. \"the population of byford is set to boom over the coming decade and it's important we properly plan for that growth with the infrastructure for tomorrow.\" federal minister for population, cities and urban infrastructure alan tudge said the upgrades will improve safety and efficiency. \"the morrison government has prioritised critical infrastructure and that also means jobs for hard working west australians,\" mr tudge said. \"along with the tonkin highway extension and byford rail extension, it will also mean more jobs and greater economic opportunity in our region.\" wa transport minister rita saffioti said these upgrades would transform thomas road and change the way people in byford and the south-eastern suburbs travel. \"these upgrades will completely transform the area and improve safety and efficiency for the thousands of drivers who use thomas road every day,\" she said. \"the removal of the thomas road level crossing is the first step in the byford rail extension which will give people in byford better connections to work, school and fun.\" federal member for canning andrew hastie welcomed the upgrades, saying they would make a big difference to road safety for the local community. \"as i've been saying for many years, infrastructure development in byford over the past decade has not kept up with the explosion in population,\" mr hastie said. \"our community has put up with thousands of daily commuters and heavy trucks travelling on what are often basically country roads. this isn't safe and it has led to many accidents. \"i'm very pleased to see this investment into our region by the commonwealth government begin to enter the construction phase. the thomas road upgrades - particularly to the kargotich and nicholson road intersections - will make our community much safer.
